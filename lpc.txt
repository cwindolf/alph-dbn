Samoan men? Or females? Man?
Do you have Samoan females, available...that we could wrestle with?
[laughs]
To wrestle us?
Uh...[laughs]...uh...not, not...

So...could you have some Samoan wrestlers?
Um...there may be this one, huge guy that...I mean, he is huge...[laughs] How much money is involved?
Ah...I would pay, uh...up to five or six thousand dollars, that's pretty much the budget for this.

But you're not gonna do anything to them?
Pardon?
You're not gonna do anything to them?

We won't get hurt, I mean...just, it's more of the visual thing.
You mean...um...I mean, explain the purpose of this to me. Are you gonna fight back? Are you gonna be playing instruments, while they're doing this?
Right.
Okay...are you gonna fight back?

Nah, their egotistical, bud. Yeah, just fucking cleaned my house, about to lift some weights.
Ah, really? You need me to show, show ya, you want me to come over so you can learn at the feet of the master?
Shit, why you dream so much, dude? (laughs) The reality of, the fact of the matter, and the reality of the matter is that I'd crush your skull. With one punch. One punch.
Yeah, you meet up my stick.
(LPC voice removed from recording) One punch will crush you. I'd crush your chest. Ribs. Put a hole right through your body, bud. You don't know. If all you're gonna talk is a stick and a whip, which is totally irrelevant to anything (chuckle) I'll just have to let you go. Talk about whips, huh? You don't play for no band, dude. No, you don't.
(LPC Voice) Yeah, I do.
What's it called?
Forbidden Nectar.
Forbidden Nectar?
Yeah.
(LPC voice removed from recording) What the fuck is that? See, you couldn't even think of a name, so you had to make one up. Ahh, what do you play? You don't play no strings, dude. You never heard of a band, you don't know any bands in Denver. Oh, you know I live in Denver. I don't like punks, man. I don't like 'em. They bother me. I guarantee you could bring a log, you could bring a fucking pipe...'cause, 'cause, all you do is talk shit. You don't play in a band. Listen dude, I'm gonna tell you only once, man, only once. I guarantee you could bring a log, you could bring a fucking pipe...
(End of track)
A whip? What are you after?
Whip?... What is it?
Oh, a whip?
Oh, no. A whip. How would we...
[Beep]
... a whip?
[Laughing]
I don't understand what you're after.
(Repeating hacking noise)
No.
[Chuckles]
A whip? I'm sorry, we don't have those here.
Canned Cool Whip?
Uh huh.
Yeah. Yeah, we got a lot of that.
Of whip.
(Beep)
(Cough)
What's the beeper for?
It's my package, sir.
(Cough) Your package? What kind of package?
What language are you speaking?
(Beep)
Okay, that's y--
(Beep)
--your smart ass remark for everything.
Okay, whelp...
I'll hang you
, pal.
I'll hang you
I wouldn't have any place to graze the live lambs.
The lambs are filled with helium?
What?
How could they be live if they were
[Beep]
filled with helium?
What are you saying? Wha- what are you trying to say?
What I'm trying to say... You said that I have a delivery of live living lambs. As in the animals. Am I correct?
Yes.
How
[Beep]
could they be filled with helium and still be alive?
They're floating within a package.
So they're live packaged helium lambs?
Why don't you just take them out of the package and let them float here?
Hey, you can come on over. You can get a taste of my [Beep] whip anytime.
I'll see ya out front.
Come on. Come on.
Nuh uh. You'll be eating some twelve-gauge lead.
Well, you must be drunk 'cause I'm not--
No. I'm not interested in it.
What do you want?
I need to bring you your package.
You need to bring us a package?
Right.
Of what?
Uh uh your helium cakes.
Brother,
[Beep]
are you ever high.
What?
[Whistling noise]
Ma'am?
Listen, I'll get you, you son of a bitch.
What are you- What are you- What are you calling from?
Where do you live? Wise up!
What d'you care, sumbitch?
Wise up. Where do you live?
Where do you want to meet? I'll meet you right now.
OK, you got it.
You gonna meet up with my boot in your mouth. How does that sound?
You
son of a bitch.
Oh,
if I could get you. If I could get you.
[Beep] You hear that beep?
Yeah.
That's you, buddy.
...motherfucker, it's like this...you've got the balls, I've got the guts...we'll meet out in the parking lot. Anytime.
Aw, bullshit...so, I'll tell you what...anytime you come around here...you better be...[tone]...armed to the teeth, guy.
I'm gonna...I'm gonna bust your teeth, how's that sound?
Aw, bullshit. 'Cause I've got news for you...I ain't
got
no teeth for you to bust! Come on over and do it, mister!
Talk's cheap!
Talk's cheap, man! Put your mouth where your foot-...put your fist where your mouth is! 'Cause that's exactly where I'm gonna put mine!
You're gonna be going to the...
...my fist where your mouth is!
Mister...I have seen death so many times. I've been shot, I've been knifed...[tone]...skull blown and no show.
Oh, yeah...I'll...you show me your lip, I'll put it on the pavement. 'Cause I've got news for you...we'll
all
have a big pow-wow!
And it ain't gonna be...it'll be me, and my fist, and you kissin' the earth!
Aw, come ON,
man
...put him six feet under,
I put you...fuckheads underneath the ground so far, you guys have to...dig into China to find your pricks!
And it...you know what? You blow so much hot air, I could probably put the phone to my dick-
You is
all-blow
, and
no-show
. If you ain't gonna show, don't even blow!
We don't sell nectarines here.
A denim clacket... I don't even know what that is.
We...whip.
[exhale]
Well...[tone]
Room 12, sucker.
Oh, I have to come to...12?
Yeah.
Right, I'll be there in a minute...
No, you won't.
Why not?
Cause my fist'll be at the door, waitin'.
[exhale]
Then, good.
[tone]
What're you gonna do about it? Okay, what are you prepared to do at that point?
Maul
ya.
I just needed to bring you your package.
Ah...what package is this?
Um...the helium biscuits?
[tone]
[inhales] I
think
...we had best
stop this nonsense
. We did not. Order.
Anything
. Did not...
No way
, buddy. Who am I?
You're the recipient of the package, at this point...
My name, is
what
Sir...are
you
off-base. You've had it, son.
You know, you're so bad...you know? ah...y'know...you're recording somethin', and...you know, it's fine with me, 'cause I don't have anything to hide.
Uh...I don't know what the situation is with you.
Oh, yeah, yeah...you're bad, aren't ya?
Yeah, little bitty kids, asking...[tone]...thinkin' back to little Travis, but they're calling the wrong number, thinking their buddy lives here.
Huh. Yeah, but do you wanna play, or something?
With little kids, I guess.
You're gonna be playin' with my whip...if you don't put him on.
Hey, fuck you, pal! 'Kay? You under[tone]stand my language? There is no Travis here, and what can I tell you to...to fuck off?
Well... Uhh... I don't believe you're Candice. [Laugh] Do you have- Do you have your membership number?
Um, not handy. Well, I'm-
Not handy?
I'm-
What's your address?

TO BE CONTINUED
What do you mean?
Well, I was just seeing what you were doing.
Why?
Because it's important to me.
To who?
To me... and...
What?
... I was curious.
[Beep]
I don't know why.
What's the matter.
I need to bring over a lamb.
What number do you want?
This one.
No, you don't.
Yes, ma'am. I have the lamb at this point.
[Beep]
Is that gonna be feasible?
Nope. Sure ain't.
[Laughing]
Why not?
Why should it be?
Lamb... You can't deny lamb.
Nope. I can give you the cop's phone number.
What?
[Beep]
Do you wanna talk to the cops?
What are you talking about?
Well, my husband's home now. He [ ? ] the Jefferson County cop.
Yeah.
You can talk to him. He came home to eat.
What are you talking about?
You know what I mean!
H-
You ordered the helium muffin.
Pardon me?
You ordered the helium muffin.
Helium muppet?
Pardon me?
What are they, helium?
Muffins.
Helium muppets? At what address?
Muffin.
Muffin. At what address? Well, it - helium? Uh, what is it supposed to be used for?
Hey, did - it's a helium sprocket.
Helium sprocket? It might've been - well, was it for a Robert Rico?
Uh-huh.
Okay, then that's who it's for then. I'm the stepson-in-law. Yeah, to Robert Rico? A helium socket? Is that what you're saying? A helium bracket.
Yeah.
Well, if Robert Rico ordered it, I guess he ordered it. Yeah, there's somebody -
Did he order a laaamb?
A what?
Laaamb.
Lamb?
Yes.
I really don't know. Did he get a lesbian?
Did he get a helium lesbian?
I really don't know what you're tryin' to say.
What are you - I'm sorry?
I really don't understand what you're tryin' to say.
Did he - did Robert Rico pick up a helium lesbian?
I really don't know. If he picked up a helium lesbian. No, I don't. No, I'm just repeating what you said.
Which is?
You're talkin' 'bout a helium socket, right?
Uh-huh.
From Fingerhut, right?
Yeah?
I really don't know what you're tryin' to say. I really don't understand your conversation because you would have to talk to him, and at this time he's not at home.
Is he with that helium lesbian, or...?
I don't - I don't know what you're tryin' to say.
What do you mean?
A helium lesbian. What the hell is a helium lesbian?
What is it?
Yes.
You tell me. You ordered it. You ordered the lesbian.
No, I didn't.
Hello? Are you bringin' somethin' from Fingerhut? The person I was talking to said something about a lesbian, helium, now what the hell is he talkin' about?
What are you s- what are you sayin'? I'm the supervisor here. What - could you go over that again?
Okay, I told him there is somethin' here for a Robert Rico? Is that who it's supposed to be shipped to?
Right.
Okay. Robert Rico is at, uh, the hospital.
Mm-hmm.
I really have no knowledge of what he ordered.
Okay.
First he said somethin' about a helium socket, or lamp or whatever.
Uh-huh.
Then he said somethin' about a helium lesbian, and I really don't understand what kind of item this is because I did not order it. I didn't even understand his conversation.
Let - let me interrupt you for a second. He said helium...
lesbian?
That's what he said.
What - now what - go over that part again. I just don't - I'm not following you there.
He said somethin' about a helium
lesbian.
Did I order a
lesbian,
and I don't know if he meant it as a item or to be cute. Sarcastic, whatever. Now, whatever Robert Rico ordered from Fingerhut, that's - whatever he ordered, he ordered.
Helium putty. So can we go ahead and take that out to you?
Helium
putty?
Uh-huh.
I didn't order no helium putty.
Putty?
Huh?
Putty?
P-U-T-T-Y?
Right.
I don't know what the hell that is. I didn't order nothing from Fingerhut. I mean, I have no dealings with Fingerhut.
No, it's not from them, it's just the Helium Putty Center, I guess.
Helium Putty
Center?
Mm-hmm.
No, I didn't order nothin'. I don't know what you're talkin' about. I really don't. I don't understand what the item is, I don't know what it is, and I don't know if it's to a Robert Rico here... is this all from Fingerhut or what? I don't know, I really don't know, because
he's
the one who deals with Fingerhut, not me.
Okay, but I owe - I owe you, Ray, right? Raymond? I owe you a helium flicket.
I don't know - I don't know what you're talkin' about. I really don't.
Okay, so what don't you understand about that?
I don't know what the hell it is.
What? Which - what is?
A helium flicket. You know, I'm not tryin' to be cute. I really don't know what the item is, or the product. I really don't.
Sir, we've come a long way from - all the way from Lebanon to be brought -
Lebanon?
To be brought to your home, yeah.
Lebanon?
On that one.
Who is the sender?
Uh, it's from a Donald Chakka.
I don't know no Donald Chakka. And if, uh, the owners of the home ordered something, I think you better be dealing with them, because I really ain't gonna be paying for somethin' that I don't know nothin' about, honest to god. I don't know no Donald Suckett
[sic]
or whatever it is from Lebanon, neither. So I really am sorry.
But the one I'm talkin' 'bout's the helium butt sprocket.
I don't know what the hell a helium butt sprocket is. Is that just an item that he ordered from Fingerhut?
Which item are you referring to?
Oh god. The one you were just talkin' about. The large package freight. You're talkin' 'bout the butt sprocket, right?
Are you familiar with that last product?
No, I'm not. I'm not even familiar with the first product.
Which - what - which -
Any
of 'em.
What's the last one that I needed to deliver? Just -
[laughs]
I just forgot.
Alright, just bring
all
your packages after five o'clock. He should be here.
[Rose Medical Center Information.]
Chisels? What would that be?
Do you... have a chisel?
[Beep]
That's what I need right now at this point.
I'm not sure what you mean by "chisel."
You know what a mallet is?
Mallet... A mallet is like a hammer.
Do you have a gong?
[Beep]
No.
What?
Gong?
Yeah.
No.
No what? I just don't follow you there.
No I-- We don't carry that. I don't...
You don't carry what?
A gong,
[Beep]
a mallet, a chisel, a...
Pardon?
We don't carry that. No.
You don't carry what?
a mallet or a gong or a chisel.
Now let's just end this conversation.
(TRANSCRIPTION IS INCOMPLETE - First 20 seconds of track starts with audio of some speaker/preacher. Then the first caller to the radio talk show speaks for a bit. I have not transcribed this, but will try and come back to do so.
Transcription starts at approximately 35 seconds into call).
Let's get some thoughts from John, here in Lakewood. Hi John.
How you doing tonight?
Alright.
Yeah, uhhh, I don't know. First of all, I think (unintelligible) censorship, and realize this has been pretty much beaten to death. With 2 Live Crew they've got so many other things to worry about besides the heyday, or the negative press they've been getting, they've got helium to worry about now, which is something that's just opened up a whole new ballpark for them.
Helium?
Right. And now they've got mallets on stage, where are they gonna stop, that's my question?
(laugh) Yeah, I guess the next thing would be sacrificing human beings on stage, but then you see they'd be breaking the law, then that would be killing.
Yeah, but I mean at this point they, ummm, they've already begun to use helium. I just don't see the valid, the validity in that, do you have any insight on that?
No, using helium in what way?
Um, on stage.
Well, I mean how would they use helium?
Ummmmmmm, they, they...
...You mean they suck it in and they talk?
Right.
Oh.
And then they actually mount lambs, they saddle lambs on stage, and I don't see this as entertainment of any form. I may be wrong, but I think it's true that the cooler you are, the more willing you are to accept it.
Yeah, well, I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose...
Absolutely.
...as to what is art and what is entertainment, so, uh, You know if you don't like that kind of act, you don't have to go see it, I guess.
But the lamb thing is what really strikes me as being kind of odd.
Well, ummm, if they're hurting the lamb, then perhaps animal cruelty charges can be filed.
But that's the thing, they're giving the helium to the lamb, that's where it's like, psyches out...
And, and, wha, you're talking about 2 Live Crew?
Right. And in fact I think it's part of this leg of the tour that's gonna be through Denver.
Well then perhaps they ought to be slapped with a charge of cruelty to animals if they can prove that helium is, uh, you know, uh, if uh, giving helium to a lamb is... is uh, harmful.
Yeah, and then they begin to use the mallets on the lamb...and I don't understand that one bit.
Yeah, well, then that is cruelty, and I would disagree with that, but uhhh, uhhh, I'm saying the performance of the music itself, uhhh, there's no reason why we should censor it.
Sure, absolutely, but one thing, how do you feel about at the end of the show where they strike a gong with a lamb?
Now, I have never seen that.
That is part of their live show, and I don't think that's a viable thing for any artist to do at this point.
MAN, see, I didn't know that. You've enlightened me here John.
(Track ends, but the next track "Circus Tickets" is a call to the same talk show host, presumably on the same day, since 2 Live Crew references are made).
(Radio Host) Alright, you got a few people there?
Yeah we got a few people here.
Ok, you all set for this Steve?
I'm ready.
Alright.
Wait, let me ask one question, do we win some kind of prize?
Well, I guess you could, we've got circus Tickets we could give ya, but you're gonna have to come down to Denver to see it.
(laughter)
Here we go OK?
Alright, go ahead.
(singing) We like to smoke (repeated, down-pitched, throughout song). I like to smoke baby / Do it every day / I like to smoke baby / don't care 'bout tooth decay / I like to smoke baby / I do it everyday / I like to smoke baby / 'cause Whitman's a little kitty (not sure about that last line).
Oh boy. Oh boy.
You got that gong out there?
Yeah, that's gonna move right up the, uhh, the top ten chart there guys. Going up to number 50. Hey thanks for the call.
(laughter and buzzer sound effect)
Yeah, I wrote it.
Well, yeah, you're pretty darn proud of it, aren't you?
(more laughter)
Alright. My, my, my. Ok, we got a call now from Burbank, California, hey Tom.
Greetings from California.
How are ya?
Not bad. We wanted the circus tickets.
You want the circus tickets?
Uh huh, and we're prepared to earn them.
Let me get Steve Krudder (?) on here for People for Smoker's Rights. Uh Steve?
Yeah, right here.
Ok, we've got a couple of participants here.
Number two, huh?
Yeah. Alright guys, have you named this song?
Yeah, it's called "Smoking Makes Me Feel Good".
(Laughter)
Alright.
Wait, was was the first song like?
Uhhhh...
I think that definitely had some high sound quality in it.
Yeah, it needed some work. Alright, so anything will do better, I think Steve will probably agree, with what we had heard 20 minutes ago.
Oh, you didn't like that one?
Uhh, it was fair.
Alright, this is Tom and who else?
And, uh, Flip.
(chuckle) Flip? Alright, Tom and Flip in Burbank, California, and you know there's talent in California. Go ahead guys.
Ok. (whistling and wheezing sounds start and persist throughout song, singing starts) Smoking makes me feel good / Every time I light a cigarette / I time I smoke it / Every time I light a cigarette / makes me feel so good / 'cause we got high hopes, high hopes / Every time I see a Marlboro red / Every time I smoke it / Every time I see a Marlboro red / It does my heart some good / 'cause we light the smokes / We're smokers.
That's it?
Yep.
Nice. (applause track plays), well, I liked it. It wasn't half bad. Steve on a scale of one to ten, what do you suppose you'd give that?
Well, we're gonna, that one's a little more on the (unintelligible), I think we might give that one an eight, and maybe even work it into the November program we have.
Yeah, I think so too. We have recorded that and we will probably play it back again periodically. Alright, well, do you want these tickets guys?
Yeah, yeah.
Alright, we're gonna give you four tickets to Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Baily Circus, at the Denver Coliseum, it's October ninth at seven thirty, and uh, you guys originally from here, or what.
Yeah, yeah, well my parents live out there.
There's a lot going on you know. You've got 2 Live Crew in town for a special Halloween concert.
Oh really?
Yeah.
I'm easily offended though.
Yeah, alright, and you'll be able to, of course, enjoy these wonderful circus tickets.
YEAH!
Ok, hang on the line, we'll get the information from you.
Thanks!
Alright (sigh) My, my my, got some desperate listeners out there Steve.
Oh, they're good at this time of the night.
Yeah, That's it.
Now I
[Beep]
need to bring you your monkey. When would be the best time for that one?
I don't know. I just want to know if you shocked my monkey. 'Cause if you shocked my monkey, I don't want him back.
I'm gonna shock your lip.
You're gonna shock my lip?
I'm gonna fracture your lip. How's that sound?
[Beep] Go ahead motherfuck.
Oh yeah. You talk big now, huh?
I get downtown, you gonna be h-- so-- so, ahh, pleasantly surprised. I'll tell you that right now.
No, I think I will be pleasantly surprised to find out that you are just a little whimpy-ass [Beep] man.
That factual?
No. It's tangible.
[Laughs]
Who am I talking with, sir?
You talking with Bob E. Sackett.
Bob E. Sackett like a sack of shit or somethin'? Haha, burn on that one.
Are you tryin' [Beep] to make fun of my name? Better just stay out of my life! [Beep] By the way, what's that damn beep?!
It's me makin' a waffle out of your face. How's that sound?
You making waffles with your dick. I don't care if you're into bestiality, but just don't do it with my monkey.
I'm gonna make a monkey outta ya.
[Beep]
Monkey outta me? Monkey outta you.
Ya, monkey see, monkey do. Burn.
Burn? Where-- Wh- Wha- Wha- Where are you getting this "burn" thing from?
Ah--
Where does it come from? [Beep] Does it come from deep from within?
Comes from my fist upside your cheek. Burn again.
Wh... What's this violence?
What's with it?
What's with it?
You. You're gonna be with it. Burn again. Triple burn.
Whoo!
Burn? [Beep] Where-- What is this thing with "burn"? I'm not burning. You're not burning.
Hello?
Yeah.
George Burn.
[Laughs]
He's pretty old.
No, who is this though?
Chris.
Oh, hey.
[Beep]
We {?} on ya. I didn't know who this was. I was prepared to be {?}.
[Laughs]
(Sound of sirens)
I don't give a shit what you think.
It's... I'm not paying it; period. I don't know what else to tell you. I did not order putty. You go get yourself some lawyers and I'll go get mine and we'll see who ordered putty. You try to drop off eight hundred dollars' worth of putty here and we'll see what happens.
I... I don't even know what putty is. Why would I order some? I work in a video game store.
I did not order putty. I don't have eight hundred dollars. I don't even know what putty is.
Um, apparently you just changed your mind on a product, but in this...
No, I didn't just change my mind on the product. I did not order putty.
In this case, though, it's, uh... it's a bit more serious because you're dealing...
Well, fine.
You're dealing with a perishable here.
Good. It's not mine. You do what you guys need to. I... I'll be more than happy to go to court over it.
I hate to be rude to you, buddy, but you got the wrong number.
Yeah, I don't want any putty, buddy.
I did not make any order. I don't know what buttock putty is and I don't want it. I don't have a building and I think you got the wrong number.
And it's...
Bring it right here, pal! Don't mess around! You got it?
I just need to know what's the best time of day to deliver on it.
I'll tell you where to deliver it... 'cept my daughter's in the room.
Drugs or what? How come you can't answer a simple question?
I'm the one asking the questions here.
I'm the one asking the questions.
Well, no you... no you aren't. That's where you're wrong again. Wh... but what part of the... what part of the, you know, establishment does this go to?
I'm gonna tell you... again. You've got the wrong number. You've written it down wrong. You've done something wrong. They gave you wrong number. I don't know who you are. I don't want your putty. I don't know what putty is used for. I don't use putty.
It's magnetic buttock putty.
I have not a clue what you do with magnetic buttock putty.
Well, you must... you must...
And you can use it for your buttocks as far as I'm concerned.
I don't buy anything from an Indonesian buttock center.
I might blow your fuckin' head off.
Your not gonna talk to me in (?). I got somethin' that'll stop you. (?) my 12-gauge shot gun will take care of that.
You can't bring no package here.
[Beep]
I gotta deliver your Dudley.
I don't want no Dudley. Now, you keep it, you hear? And Don't call here no more.
Well, you gotta k-
[Hang up]
Well, bring the muthafucka on.
Uh, look. You're not gonna bring anything here. You understand what I'm sayin'?
Well, sir--
Do you-- Do you catch my drift?
Now stop the bullshit. Do you catch my drift?
Ok.
[Beep]
I'd like to talk to you like a god damn man You don't wanna talk to one, you've got the address and the phone number and the god damn location. I'll be here waiting. Bring it on.
[Hang up]
What in the hell is a suction?
A
section
or a
suction
You suck... like a straw...
What is it?
Do I need to bring over my fist or somethin'?
Your face?
My fist.
Your fish?
My fist.
Oh, yeah?
How's that sound to ya?
That's nice. Come on over, buddy.
Oh. You're gonna beat me up now.
You mean-- I ordered your fists
[Beep]
to beat me up, huh?
Oh, yeah? Are you, uh... prepared to, uh... talk to the, uh... state police right--
[Beep]
Oh, you're gonna beat him up too. Oooh. I'll tell him that. He's, uh, over there. He's got his patrol car there in the driveway and I-- I'll tell him to come on over. We've got a guy
[Beep]
comin'.
Oh, you're gonna shove me into the police officer.
Ooh. I see. I've committed a crime.
Where are you now?
[Beep]
You're in pudding?
Yeah.
Suction
pudding
... I don't know what it is. Do you?
Go!
I need to ship Otis.
Well you ship Otis. Go ahead and ship him. I ain't got nothin' to do with it.
[Beep]
Did you hear what I say?
I heard you but uh... that's not valid.
Otis is your delivery.
Well... It's not mine.
[Sample from a long lost Mr. T soundboard]
Monkeys.
Why didn't you just say you were afraid to fly?
I ain't afraid to fly and I ain't afraid of no monkeys neither.
Transcriber notes: LPC's voice is not heard on this track at all. These are presumably calls which LPC engineered in such a way that people would call his voicemail and leave the below messages. Several are hard to understand, which is why there are several "unintelligible" sections.
Chris it's Maxine, Hi. I had my halo taken off, and tried to kill someone. Bye. (Transcription Note: This entire line is hard to understand and may need much correction).
Hi I'm, ummm, I'm calling for Robert. Uh, he said he ran into Cornelius Fiddlebone. He gave Robert the elastic and the helium is in the mailbox. That's the message I was supposed to give ya. Bye.
Hi, I have a message from Robert for Chris. I ran into, he says, I ran into Cornelius Fiddlebone, and he gave me the elastic giraffe. He said to go inside his mailbox.
Oh, I guess your message is done, alright. This is for Chris from Ian: Grandpa Fiddlebone gave Cornelius all the lesbians he emitted. Helium (Note: unintelligible section, sounds like: "round polo five yaz you") elastic alligator in his mailbox, and also Carrie Fisher's marbles were in the suitcases. That's about it. (laughs) Alright, lay off the bong hits guys.
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Hi, uh... Who's this?
Robert.
Hey. How's it going? Yeah, I was wondering if you could--
Hey, man. What are you talking shit to my brother for, man?
What are you talkin' dude?
What?
[Beep]
Do you want me to talk shit with my fist to your lips?
What?
Do I have to bust your lips buddy?
Hey, man. Why are you always talking shit, calling my fucking house, man? Don't talk shit to my brother.
I'm talking shit to you, mister.
Yeah, you talk shit to me
[Beep]
'cause I don't fucking know who your sorry ass is, and I can't fucking get you.
I just wanted you to play with our band, Liquified Mummy.
What you tryin' to lie for, man?
Liqui- Liquified Mummy, dude. That's the name of our band, dude.
You don't got no damn band.
What? Yeah I do. Liquified Mummy, brother.
[Beep]
No you don't.
Look man, you gonna talk shit? I'm gonna come over and put on my cleats to your face. How does that sound?
[Incoherent words]
[Hang up]
Hello?
Hello, is Ian there?
No, I'm sorry. He's not. May I take a message?
Umm... no.
Okay.
[Beep]
Uh, ma'am?
Yes?
Can you tell him that Mummy called?
I'm sorry, who?
Mummy.
Monique?
[Beep]
Nipper is a gardening product.
What?!
No it isn't!

It's meat?
Yeah.

Uh, yeah...what do you do with wasp meat?
It's for eating.
Oh, it's for eating?
Uh-huh.
Well...
Could you...could you grind Emilio for me, would that be a problem?
I have...I don't even know what Emilio is.
[Volume II]
Edit
This is Steve. May I help you?
Yeah. I need some eel... jerky made.
Oh, you've got the meat?
The eel meat, yeah.
Nah, we're still doing game processing this time of year.
Can you make any wasp jerky for me? I've got that all uhh... USDA approved already.
There ya go. Where'd ya get 'em from?
Oh, we trap them.
Huh... Whatever.
Make wad out of snake meat.
What's wad?
Make a big wad out of it.
[Pause]
Look it... I'm tryin' to work. I don't know what you're tryin' to do.
Can you handle eel bowel?
Eel... bowel? You got deer meat, elk meat, or antelope meat, I'll be happy to process it into anything that you want.
Antelope wad.
[Pause]
What the hell's an antelope wad?
Okay, what's your number. I'll call you back. Ain't got time right now. I'm tryin' to hang sausage.
Well... Could you... Can you hang the bowel for me and just let it dry at least?
C'mon. You're strokin' me here. I-
I don't hang it. Eel bowel. That's exotic. I've never seen it in Safeway.
Hey, look it, I'm trying to make sausage.
I need you to... to ma-... to make eel bowel wad.
I don't wanna do it.
Volume III
Edit
[Nonsense noise]
Ummm... You... the zebra tonsil.
Oh, I remember you. You ain't called for a long time. What've you been doin'?
Oh, I've been workin'.
I know. Yeah, you used to call for some kind of goofy other stuff. This is the guy that's got nothin' to do but... make stupid statements. I remember.
Umm...
[To several other people on his end] This guy used to call and ask for wasp woonies or some shit like that.
Haha. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so you still ain't got a job, two years now, huh?
Umm... I don't.. I don't know who... who--
First of all, you can't sell zebra meat.
I don't--
You can't- You can't bring it into the country.
What?
What's the number?
I don't feel that's been necessitated. But--
What's the number? I'll just call you back. Your phone number.
K. I'll hook you up with that. One moment. Umm...
What's your phoen number? I'll call you right back.
Not a problem.
[Pause]
Looks like--
What's your phone number?
--we've got... you know...
What's your phone number?
I'll provide you with it in one moment. I need to know where I'm supposed to put the tonsil, first off. Where... d'ya have like a tonsil yard or something that I need to go to?
[Laughter]
[To other people on his end] Pick up the other line. You gotta listen to this guy.
Is there really such a thing as a...a Martian?
Yeah, sir?
Yes?
Can you please dispel a little bit of the information about your baked goods, please?
Umm...if this is a prank, I won't, but if this serious, yeah, I will.
Sir...sir, I have a valid inquiry about your baked products.
Okay, what did you need to know?
I need a general overview on, uh, what you currently stock, in the breaded...ah, delectable goods...ah...area.
As far as bread...we carry...a lot of bread...and cakes, and cookies.
Wait a minute, let me back up a second...um...you were implying I was, uh, giving you a prank about breads? Is that what you're saying?
Uh, no, we've probably had four f- prank phone calls before this.
In the whole history of your store? That's pretty good.
Is this...is this funny to you, or something?
Bread, sir? No, it's not...
No, we're not talking bread...we're talking...you brought up the same thing you talked about last time.
Which is what?
Ah...some kind of...grasshopper mash, for fishin'?
Oh, you're going fishin'?
[laughing] Shit...Jesus Christ. You guys been smoking crack, or what?
Hey, lookit, I got- I'm trying to make sausage.
Do you have a pewter loaf?
No, we don't.
How about...do you have, ah, any tapes by Ry Cooder?
No, we don't.
Thank you for calling Domino's Pizza, this is Troy, would you like to try our...Colorado Special?
Boy, how are you doing tonight, sir?
I'm alive.
Sensational to hear from you. Umm...I'd like to order a grover loaf.
A grover loaf?
Right.
No kiddin'.
Hello?
Robert Rico?
Yeah?
Um... I just need to...know where I'm supposed to put your zebra, tomorrow.

Yeah,
Evergreen Motel
Yep.
Yeah, lemme tell you something, mister...let me tell you a thing or two, mister!
Okay...I'm listenin'.

I don't know who the fuck you're even talkin' to, old buddy.
You're gonna be talkin' to my foot, after I...fix it in your cheek. How does that sound?
I'll tell you what, motherfucker. You better know what the fuck you're talking about.
Ah...my fists know what they're saying. And they're going to be saying it rather loudly to your face,
how's that sound
?! Huh?
[echoing clip]
Your choice, slug or buckshot?
Well, talk to me a little bit more.
Yeah-
Cocksucker, if you're not who I'm thinking I'm talking to, you better know what the fuck you're talkin' to!
You're gonna be talkin to the ground, after you're laying on it.
I'll tell you what, prick. Why don't you just tell me where to meet you, and I'll tell you what, I will be fucking there. 'Cause I don't want to hear your fucking shit, I don't want to tell you shit, motherfucker, you...

Yeah, you'll be there, but your lips ain't leavin', 'cause they're gonna be on the ground.
You talk real tough over the phone, kid.
Yeah, I'm gonna bust your teeth-

Tell you what, motherfucker. You ain't tough enough to bust my fuckin' teeth.

I got whip.
I don't give a fuck if you've got a whip, I don't give a fuck if you've got a chain, I don't give a fuck if you've got a shotgun. Don't fucking start-
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE FUCKING WITH!
Yeah, you're gonna meet up with my horse whip.
Yeah...you're a fuckin' cunt. All you got to do is jack off and fuck someone in the fuckin' eye.
You started it, now BACK IT UP! BACK IT UP, ASSHOLE!
You come here, you fuckin' tell me about it.

Hey, enough of this telephone shit. We're coming right by there right now, fucker.
Well, come by. I'll tell you what, motherfucker, you better be...you better be packing a fuckin' gun, 'cause it's the only way you're fuckin'...

Yep. Come on, come on. Come on. Uh-uh. You'll be eating twelve gauge lead.
I got fuckin' chain, I'm gonna take to...take to your lip.
I don't give a fuck if you've got a fuckin' shotgun, motherfucker. You're talkin' to the wrong fuckin' guy, here.
Nope. You're gonna be...
You're callin', hasslin' somebody, you're fuckin' with the wrong guy. And I'll tell you what, if you pull in this fuckin' parking lot, you better fuckin' go back out.
I'm gonna bust your teeth.
Yeah?
How's that sound to ya?
Well...hey, buddy.
Listen up, you son of a bitch!
...over here, we'll see what happens, okay?
Ah, you- you're gonna be seein' stars, after I'm done with you.
[laughs] I hope you know who the fuck you're talkin' to.
Oh, if I could get you...if I could get you...
Drag your lip on the pavement.
Yeah? You think so, eh?
If you ain't gonna show, don't even blow!
Hey, I'm not jokin' with your fuckin' tape recorder, motherfucker.
Hey, you wanna get your shit kicked? You come over here.
Hey. Don't talk to me like that. Fuck you.
[Unclear]... I ain't scared of nobody. And who the fuck d'you think you're talking to, cock sucker?
Li- uh... Listen, we have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah. Fuck you.
Yeah. They get the stomach. You know it's called uhhh.... I don't even know that it's called. The tripe. They get the tripe and the... liver and the kidney is the only thing we're able to get.
Hey. You wanna get your shit kicked? You come over here.
What is your problem anyway?
Right now I don't really give a fuck. Okay?
As I said, if you want any of the things besides those thing, you have to check with the packing house.
We are not able to get any... any thing besides the liver... a kidney... and... and... and a stomach lining is what it is. A tripe.
We're not able to get anything... I don't even know if cows have tonsils, to tell you the truth. So...
I... Yeah, I... I don't really give a fuck right now.
We can't get no bowel.
You're making a fool of yourself.
I ain't... I ain't afraid of nobody.
What is your problem?
You are one weird dude.
[Laughing] I don't motherfucking care. I-
You make no sense whatsoever. You're so dumb. You make no sense.
I don't understand- Nobody can understand what you're talking about. You're one dumb person and you make no sense whatsoever.
Who the fuck d'you think you're talkin' to, cock sucker?
Go and take a shit and--
...you think you're talkin' to here?
No. I will not let you finish! You make no sense whatsoever!
You... You wanna get your shit kicked? You come over here.
You're talking some bullshit now. Now you knock your shit off and don't call back anymore. Okay?
Who's this?
This is Hugh.
Who?
Hugh.
Hugh?
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?
Play the cymbal.
Play a cymbal?
Yeah...For our band Lesbian Mummy.
(Chuckle) Is this a joke man?
No man, come on bud. Hundred bucks dude, for the cymbal.
A hundred bucks for a cymbal?
Yeah.
I don't get what you're tryin' to tell me.
You're either gonna play the cymbal on stage for us tonight, or I'm gonna take a cymbal to your lip tomorrow.
How'd you get my name?
Huh? That's not important.
Yeah it is.
No it isn't. I'm gonna bring over a cymbal and take it to your face.
Your gonna get...a cymbal?
Yeah.
And I'm gonna play it?
No. I'm gonna take it to your face in a minute.
You're gonna take it to my face?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna play the cymbal off your face, how's that sound?
Your gonna play the cymbal off my face?
Yeah.
Anytime motherfucker. (Track end)
NOTE: I believe the below previously transcribed text to be incorrect, but perhaps it is part of a different track?
What the fuck's your deal, man? What are you so fuckin' pissed off about?
Ah...fuck you, you pussy.
Fuckin' pussy.
You gonna play the cymbal off my face?
Any [tone] motherfucker. Come on down.
You talk pretty fuckin' tough, man.
Monkeys?
Stop calling this number!
[Cough]
You want me to call the police?
All I'm trying to do is make-
How old are you, anyway?
Well, I'm twenty-eight, sir.
Twenty-eight?
Yes-
You don't sound like a twenty-eight-year-old. You sound more like a [Beep] seventeen-year-old.
That's not factual.
This is the third telephone call from wise guys like you.
Yeah, you're a wise guy.
Now look, why don't you do something else.
Well, how 'bout working for us, sir-
I don't wanna work for you people.
W-
You call my telephone number, you get it off a telephone... What do you work for? What... Who do you work for and who [Beep] are you?
I work for the
whip
Oh the whip, huh? That's terrific.
I won't work for you. [Beep] Didn't you hear this four times?
No.
You didn't. Alright. Well, listen again... Watch my lips through the telephone.
I don't wanna work for you.
Why not?
I don't have to explain why not.
That's not valid, sir.
Oh, [Beep] you're a wise guy. You're a smart ass wise guy.
[Unintelligible]
I- I don't know how to- I don't know how to talk to a young punk like you. Are you recording this?
No.
Okay...
You have to pee in the cup. [Unknown Sample]
[laughs] Well, no, this is a shop.
Right.
Yeah.
I was wondering if I could square dance for a little bit, in there.
Well, I don't think so.
I have this little act where I hold snakes in my mouth.
Just saying...I've got, uh...someone calling in.
Who are you, dude?
My name's Larry.
What are you doing there, man?
I live here.
Well, this is ol' Jesse, dude.
I think you got the wrong number...
No, Mike picked up my rifle for me, man.
Why don't you go piss in the ocean? What are you bothering me for? We don't take anything like that, you idiot.
Bowel? What the hell's the matter with you? Up your ass.
You're sadly mistaken.
Hold on a second, let me ask my boss.
Bob! You want some elk bowel, or bronchial tubes? They've been cleaned out.
[laughing]
Obviously, I don't know what you're talking about. But I don't want any elk bowels, or bronchial tubes.
Well, why don't you come on down here and let me put a .38 in your brain?
Hey, you guys ever heard of "eel bowel"?
[laughing]
Oh, is that...? Is he?
([laughs] He asked for it before from someone else.)
It's not? It is?
(No, we're alright.)
Sorry, we're not interested.
What's a wa- Wha- How do you wad a dog bowel?
Okay. I'm sorry. Just a second here. I 'm gonna ma- switch to a different channel here. Make sure I'm hearing you right.
[Assorted background noises]
I'm sorry about that. Uh, okay. Uh heh, Do- I- I apologize. Can we take it just one more time from the top here?
Okay. I'm afraid I'm completely lost here and I'm sorry about this, but uh, are we talking about a computer programming?
Uh, are we talking about-
Eel bowel...
[Chuckling]
You need to wad the bowel of any eel?
[Laughing]
Well, sure. I guess if you send an eel over we can take our best shot at the bronchial tube too. Sure.
We don't have any.
Digital bowels...
[Clip of what sounds like an elderly man giggling]
You better just hang up, and get off our backs, you understand?
John-
Hang it up...no, no.
No.
Just hang it up. Okay? You threatened me once, you didn't follow through with it, okay? You wanna come over here, bud, I'll be sitting here, okay? Now, if you wanna come over here, you step one thing on my property, and I see one kind of weapon, anything. I will make the Make My Day Law, bud. And I
will
guarantee that, and I will back it up. Because right now, you are on a recording. UPS bullshit, somebody calling me up, saying '
yeah, oh, I'm UPS
!' Well, you can
kiss my UPS ass
No, I didn't make no order for no dog bowel package.
How much you wanna bet on that?
What's your name?
Because I'm going to sue you, that's what I'm going to do.
Now look, bud. Get off my back, is all I gotta say.
You're most certainly going to pay for them, Dave.
What do you wanna bet on that?
I don't even wanna see you, bud, so just keep out of my hair.
I ordered a bowel?
Buddy, you're threatening me right now, and I'm putting it on recording, and I want you to repeat that.
I ordered a bowel? What bowel?
I don't even know what you're talking 'bout.
Well, how much you wanna bet on that, bud?
You go to hell. Goodbye.
[receiver clicking, mumbling]
We ain't doin' no business, 'cause I didn't order nothing.
I don't know what I order.
I'll get the damn law after your ass.
[repeat] (
I don't know what I order.
I did not order nothing from you, do you understand?
Bullshit!
I'll get the damn law after your ass.
Sir-
You're full of shit!
And it-
Did you hear what I said? I said, I did not order no
dog shit
from you!
Put your head in between your ass. How would you like that?
You're outta your mind! Don't bring anything over here, because I don't know what the hell you're talking about!
What is a dog bowel? A butt bowel? What is that?
Listen, don't fuckin' call over here, gettin' rude with my mother! Are you fuckin' CRAZY? What the
fuck
are you talking about? You are a sick bastard, you know that?
Hey, don't mess with me, fucker! Do you...are you stupid, or what?
Hey, you come over here with your fish, you stupid bastard! Why don't you come over here right now? I'd
love
to see this!
Right now?
You know what bastard, you're gonna pay! He's such a fuckin' jackass!
Well, just...come on over, okay? Come on over, you stupid ignorant...fucker.
You know what, you son of a bitch? You can try to come over and hit me in the lips! [laughs] You're a jackass!
You gotta be out of your mind, jack!
You really scare the shit out of me.
Now, I'll see you in a few minutes.
I don't give a shit if you want to get tough or not, buddy. I'll twist your head off!
You just talkin' shit, I don't believe you're brave enough to come down here now!
Let's go! Let's go, buddy! I ain't done this in a while, I'll enjoy it!
I could, I could sell you a trachea if you wanted it, but that's as close as I could do, I...
Butt bowel?
Hey. You ain't gettin' rough with me, bud. This is my property, and you get the hell off of it. And stay off of it.
A home potion? That's the grossest thing I've ever said in my whole life.
Fuzzy old monkey?
Good morning, Packaging Store. May I help you?
Uhhh yeah. I need to deduct some kind of package.
Deduct a package?
Is that possible?
Is this the clown again?
I'm sorry?
Yeah, this is the clown again.
[Clip of a cat purring]
(man)
Dog bowel? We'll you're wrong. We don't even have a dog.
What kind of a rip-off is this?
A bowel? From a dog? My gosh...
(woman)
(inaudible) You must be nuts! We don't even have a dog.
(man)
A butt bowel? Poop bowl? Are you on drugs?
I think you're crazy—are you drunk? Now tell me who you are.
You're a monkey, yeah.
A poop bowel?
You're a crazy monkey.
I don't know what an eel jowel is.
Oh. Okay. I'm here. Bring it on.
Kick my bowel. Yeah.
[Laughs]
Kick my bowel.
Eel bowel?
Well, no. You call somebody else. Don't use my time up messin' with me, please.
Look. Look mister, would you-- I-- I don't have time. I've got customers here.
I don't have no dog bowel. You go-- Look, call the dog pound or the city or wherever they keep the dogs. You ge-- get it from them.
Hey, this h- This here's a fish place, mister. It's not a dog place.
Goddammit! I told you! I don't sell it!
I need--
Now don't call here no more!
Hog jowel...?
Hog jowel? You're full of shit!
You want a hole in ya?
You go ahead an make my day, bro.
You were trying to bother me one day while I was having dinner... And don't do it again.
You're full of shit!
You were trying to bother me one day while I was having dinner... And don't do it again. Just leave me alone.
[Sample clip of a robotic computer guy's voice]
Well now that's really bizarre. I've never had a--
[Woman laughs in the background]
--To ever hear a message like that in my life. Now that-- I must say--
[Woman in background] That's great, you guys.
That is really bizarre.
[Cosmic whirring noise]
[Laughing]
There. You've got your toys and I've got mine. How's that?
You asked me if I had a bowel!
I suppose I do, it's inside me.
My bowel.
Stick the magnet to the bowel.
My bowel is not magnetic.
My bowel is not magnetic, and the magnet will not stick to anything that isn't magnetic.
You can do that with glue.
I'd just soon you call somebody else, I..I..this is...this is absolutely crazy.
Okay, you've called before.
What?
About the eel bowel.
You've already called before. You called two weeks ago and jerked me around with the same thing with some eel bowel stuff. I don't know who ya are. I don't know what your plan is. But you keep strokin' me. I don't know what... You've got nothing better to do?
What do you do, smoke crack for a living?
Just leave me a number where I can call you back on your mule.
Okay, good. I'll call you right back.
I just called. That's a doctor's number. Quit fuckin' with me.
Do you understand english?
Oh, you're going to get physical because we don't have mule bowels?
I wish you'd quit wasting my time. I've got a thousand things to do today.
Note: LPC's voice does not appear on this track.
Well I don't know what a mule bowel is.
Where the mule craps?
I don't know what a mule bowel looks like. I probably have 5,000 magnets in this place, and I've been doing this for 45 years. I retired 4 years ago, I'm a retired electrical engineer, and I have never heard a question similar to what you have just asked me.
Well that sounds very simple if you know what a mule bowel is.
And you're going to put a magnet on the outside of the animal, near the bowel?
Are you gonna stuff it up his ass?!?
Note: track ends with sound effects. Possibly Screaming Jay Hawkins (?), followed by a computerized voice that says "obey me and live, or disobey and die".
Are you at it again?
You called me about two weeks ago.
Come on over. Make my day, boy.
How would you...how would you like a 12-gauge in your
HEAD
? I'll put another hole in your ass!
Well, come over. Goddamnit, I'm getting tired of this bullshit. Come on over, let's see how damn bad you are. Hurry, 'cause I've got something to do pretty soon.
[Sample clip of an ominous musical tone and a lady screaming]
Will you stop this shit, boy?
Ain't gonna pay you nothing.
And just leave me alone.
Stop buggin' me.
You're full of shit.
You come in my yard, boy. Make my day.
Butt bowel...but what the hell is that?
Hernia? I didn't order no hernia! What the hell is that? I don't know!
We don't need no hernia! You don't have a hernia or nothing!
Hell no!
You're crazy!
Hernia, what's a...we don't have a hernia!
I don't...I didn't order a bowel, either.
..didn't ha-...order a bowel puppet, either.
We did NOT order any poop bowel! We most certainly did not! You have us...mixed up with somebody else!
Well, you get physical, and I'll get physical too, I'll call the police.
Okay, I'll call...I'll call the cops, right now.
We don't know what a grover bowel is.
Maybe you need a poop bowel for yourself! I haven't ordered a thing! And I already called the cops.
Poop bowel yourself!
I ordered, yeah...I called the cops already.
About
YOU
I did
NOT
order
NOTHING
, and...you shut up and get out of the phone!
Oh, you shut up! You're crazy!
A hernia bowel?
Lebanon?
Bowel? Everybody has a bowel.
You keep that up, Buster, and you've got problems. They've got federal laws against harassing on telephones.
Hog bowel? What are you talking about?
Well no. I ain't gonna pay you nothin'. What d'you-
What is this, some sort of rip off or somethin'?
Hey, listen! Who the hell you think you're shittin', I didn't order this! I have...I don't know nothing about it! You think you're talking to some old...goofy old bastard? It's not me! I never ordered no dog bowel, what the hell would I do with a dog bowel?
I don't give a shit if you bring the district attorney here, you've got the wrong guy! Wait a minute, now! You listen to me!
You know something? I've been a very honorable man this time, all my goddamn life! Just give me your goddamn name, and I'll guarantee you, I will sue you! I'm gonna sue you right now! Get a little physical abuse with a 75 year old guy? Stick around until I get my family down here, and I'll guarantee you, bring all you want! Bring everybody you want, I don't give a fuck who he is! You are talking to the wrong person, you're using a very bad,
bad
...attitude, because you are 100% wrong, I don't know what a hell- what a hog bowel is!
A
butt bowel
? What is that? You- up your fuckin' ASS, I will! Well, I'm not at any liberty to tell you whether to shove that thing up your ass, because you're talking to the wrong person! I don't know what a butt bowel...
BOB! Come here. Is this something to do with a pig? Andre the Giant bowel, you know what the hell that is? Here's a guy who's telling me I'm owing him for $189, down here if I don't take...shoes off... Can you believe this?
Well...I'm talking to a guy who raises hogs. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKIN' BRAINS OUT! Come on down, I got something to take care of you!
I don't think...
REAL quick! You drive in the goddamn parking lot here, there's a white Cadillac. I'll be standing right next to it, you drive in the lot, I'll guarantee you, I'll blow your fucking head off!
I've got an equalizer for young guys like you! I'm 75. I've got something that takes care, and we equalize the sight. You bring something with you!
I'll bring, I'll bring...
And I'll guarantee you, before you get out of the fucking car, I'll have your head blown off!
Punch me in the lip? I'll blow your fucking head off.
You
shove me around? (
I'll blow your fucking head off.
I've been a very honorable man this time, all my goddamn life
I'll blow your fucking head off
I'm gonna go tell you to
FUCK
yourself! How do you like that? (
I'll blow your fucking head off
I'll come and pick up the fucking thing up, you JACKOFF COCKSUCKER!
Boy, I wish the fuck I knew who you were. Now, you give me your fucking address, and your name, and you don't have to come down here to beat the shit out of me, 'cause I'll come over there and blow your fuckin' brains out of your fuckin' head.
Lesbian
? You sound like a fuckin' fruit to me!
I haven't the foggiest. I don't know what the hell you're talking, I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about, as far as a lesbian magnet.
Well, I'm a...
Are you pulling my leg, or what's going on here?
I don't know what you're talking about, when you use that terminology, as far as magnets are concerned. What is a hernia lesbian, what is that?
We have over 5,000,000 magnets in-house. If you could describe exactly what that is...
Wha-
...what a lesbian magnet is, I'd be more than happy to accomodate you. At this point, you're wasting my time.
Number one, who are you? Number two, who are you calling?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I hung up!
I'll be there...
...if you tell me who you are and what you want!
(Number two, who are you calling?)
(Number one, who are you?)
Are you threatening me?!
Telephone security? Trace this call. Thank you.
Hey, who are you, man?
What do you
want
, man?
I don't know you.
No, no, no, no. Bullshit.
Hey, don't be bothering me...eh?
I don't know you, eh?
Alright, alright...stop it man, eh? I'm working, I'm busy.
What do you
want
, man? Eh? Why don't you come here and talk about it? Eh?
Who are you?
I met you in the bathroom.
Where? What place?
There.
Right here, where I work?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, but I don't know...I don't remember you.
You don't remember going to the bathroom?
Yeah?
Huh?
Yeah, every day?
What do you
want
, man? Eh? Why don't you come here and talk about it? Eh? Do whatever you want with me, okay?
Hey...you better stop it, man...eh?
You don't have the balls to come over here and punch me like you say? Come here, man!
What...
You got the balls, come here!
What?
In person!
What?
Come here in person!
You want me to go to the bathroom on you?
Right here! Come here! Eh? You got-
Eh? You got the balls...come here! Show your face! You got the balls, come-
Fuck you! Just come here, man....eh? Don't be fooling around, eh?
Why don't you come over, and...try to poop on me?
Fuck
you!
This Cliff, may I help you?
Well, if you're trying to be funny, I don't appreciate it.
I'm not understanding what you're talking about. What, you're...you're talking about mules, we don't work with mules.
I think I've pretty much laid it on the line.
[unintelligible] service.
Well, now, if you tell me what the hell you want and quit being such a wiseass, I'll work with you, but until you...as long as you're being a dog- smartass, I don't have to put up with it, either!
What- come on down and talk to me about it, then! If you want to use fists, bring 'er on down!
Come on down and use your boots too, if you're man enough!
Come down and talk to me about it, then!
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes, as long as you wanna be mouthy about it!
Would you like to come down and talk to me man-to-man like that? You're awful brave talkin' to me over the phone.
I wasn't a Green Beret for 12 years for nothing, mister, so you come down and talk to me.
Oh, well you just sound like a real skinny little shithead, talk to a man over the phone and not to his face.
You...you're pretty dumb. A man that hasn't got any more to do than what you're doing is pretty useless.
You ought to just go ahead and take the shotgun and blow your brains out, 'cause you're not no good for nobody.
I'm gonna keep you on the phone for a little bit, we've been having this trouble with you, and we got someone on the police tracing the calls so we can locate you.
But I'll tell you what, if anyone ever calls you an asshole, don't argue with them.
Because I'd like to pound your fuckin' ass in, 'cause you're an asshole.
Don't argue with me, because you are an asshole. Okay?
Come down here and punch me in the goddamn bowel. I would love that. [laughs]
Look, asshole. If you're brave enough, just come down here. Quit being an asshole and just come down here and face me, you bastard. Come on in, bastard. You got it? And quit sucking off on the phone and get your ass down here, and we'll settle this for once and for all. You got it, motherfucker? Do you understand me?
In the cemetary, okay? Go and find them.
A hernia?
Yeah.
Well, I ain't got no hernia!
Well, yeah...yes, you do, sir.
No, I ain't either! Somebody's pulling my leg. I don't know who you are, but you better cut 'er out, 'cause I'm gonna turn this over to the telephone company.
Hernia package? I never ordered any po- hernia package! Where's this comin' from?
Cro-latia
?' Where's that? Yeah, come on out here! I'm ready for ya!
I...you just do whatever you want to, buster. I'm not gonna take it. And I'm not gonna pay you
nothin'
, and I'm gonna call the police if you show up out here.
I am not committing a crime.
Well, how does...
Youse the one wantin' to wrestle, buster! You's the one that said you wanted to wrestle with me!
No, I don't want to wrestle with nothin'. I don't know who you are or what you're doin', but I am gonna hang this phone up, and I'm callin tele- telephone company for harrassing telephone call.
He challenged me to a wrestling match.
No, he said he wanted to wrestle with me!
He sure did. He said, 'you wanna wrestle about it?' That's exactly what he said.
I'm 70 years old, mister. I don't have to take this stuff.
Did you...
I don't want that package, either. For a monkey bowel, or somethin'.
You're gonna wrestle a lesbian.
No, I'm not. I don't mess with lesbians, or nobody else. I'm a happily married man. And I'm not gonna put up with any more of this. What did you say your name was?
Lesbian.
Your name's "Lesbian?"
Yeah.
Mister, you're a
liar
if I've ever heard of one! We're gonna call UPS, just in about one half second. And we're gonna find out if they got anything for us, like what you been saying.
Wait...you're a lesbian, aren't you?
No, I'm not a lesbian! I'm a man, and I'm not a lesbian, and I'm not gonna put up with any more of this! 'Fact, we're gonna call the telephone company, and find out where this coming from.
Poop bowel.
Poop bowel
,' bleh! You ready, Billy? You got UPS's number looked up? I'm not gonna put up with this guy any longer, I'm through with it, and if I have to put up, if he calls me again, I'll go get the police.
You're a son of a bitch!
You want me to go to the bathroom on you?
Well, if you think you're man enough, go ahead. You're a son of a bitch!
PISS ON YOU! Piss on you, and all your goddamn crap!
You know what I mean?
My area code is 882...my...telephone number.
Just go to hell, will ya? I'm calling in, ah...this call waiting thing. I'll wait for your representative come. I'm 'onna kick his ass in the butt.

A butt barrel?
Yeah.

Scrotum?

[Co-workers in background] No.
No we don't.
Please?
Uhh. I don't think we even know how.
I got a thousand bucks for ya. All I need is like twenty-- twenty jerkies.
What is your name, sir?
I did not order anything.
You ordered a Siamese peacock bowel, sir.
No, I'd never!
You're pretty hot ny-- You try that, I'll call the police.
No. I'm ca-- I yo-- I'm calling the phone company and I'm calling the police department and I uhh... You're trying to run some kind of fraud game.
No. Don-- Don't give me that crap. I'm calling the police department.
Well you're-- You're nothing but a crook.
Well, anyway, we...we carry...ah, you know, all legal types of pornographic films, you know...all kinds...nothing like that. We have anal tapes, which is just anal sex. Ah...no kind of...what do they call it, bestiality...is legal.
Really? It's illegal?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Huh.
And, also any kind of, ah...say, they used to call them, ah...'golden fountain' type stuff, people peeing on each other, shit like that...is illegal.
Oh...I don't understand what you mean. There was videos of that?
I guess so, yeah.
Ah...have you ever seen anything like that?
Ah, many, many years ago...yes, I was in one of these stores that had stuff like that, yeah.
Like what?
[laughs] Well...you know, I don't wanna...I don't wanna have phone sex with you. Just come in and see what we have.
No...[laughing]...that's not what I mean...but, that's urinating...they urinated on each other, is that what they did?
Yeah, supposedly they had that sort of thing, yeah.
And you saw it?
Yeah...many, many years ago. I was...I was barely 18. I just turned 40, so that gives you an idea how long ago it's been.
What did you...what did you think of it at the time?
Oh, I thought it was disgusting, myself.
You did?
Yeah.
Huh. Did they poop on each other?
Oh, I've seen that before, but again...I thought it was extremely disgusting.
Huh.
I just happened to look at the wrong screen at the wrong time, and, ah...after that I just left, because I totally lost interest in anything, after that.
Hmm...would it be, ah...would it be equitable if I were to poop on you, at this point?
[laughs] Goodbye.
Uhh... Do you have any uhh... Bulk uhh... peacock bowel there, sir?
Ehhhh. We've got one on the telephone right now. That'd be
you
Well I don't--
[Hang up]
Hold on a minute 'cause I can barely hear you. Now start over. What-- What do you have for us?
You ordered a Siamese Peacock Bowel.
Uh. Not here.
From Siam... Yeah.
Bring it now. And if we don't like it, we'll send it back.
You will pay for it in cash--
No, we will not!
Now, sir--
Don't tell us what we'll do. We'll do what we wanna do. It's our business. We don't have to accept anything.
Why-- Why do you wanna even bother talking to us like that?
I don't even know what a Siamese... Peacock Bowel is. The only bowel I know is you.
Look. I don't have to play these games. When is the best time--
I don't either. And I'm getting sick and tired of playing these games. Alright? If you wanna be here in ten minutes, be here in ten minutes. The shipment can come in ten minutes. And if you could be here in ten minutes, I'd like you to.
How about if I punched you in ten minutes?
I-- I'd like to see you try to punch me in ten minutes.
How-- You-- You ordered a lesbian.
You are.
What?
You are, aren't ya?
What?
A lesbian.
[Talking to other people on his end away from the phone]
He called me a fag. 'Cause if he comes over here I'm gonna grind him up into
sausage
! 'Cause when I knock him down, they won't find him.
Hello?
Yeah...Delmo?
Ah...he's in the bathroom right now. Wanna call back...in a little while?

I can't talk to anybody like that.
Did you talk to Pujol?
Don't know him, either.

...and we got Raymond in Golden, next on KBIG 1090. Hi, Raymond.
Gentlemen...gentleman calling...was ah...traveling through the Bow Mar county recently, and I...saw Rich Karlis, and...
We're having a hard time hearing you, Ray, ah...Raymond...
You can't hear me?
Now we can. You're off the speaker, go ahead.
As I was saying to you gentlemen, I was counting through the Bow Mar county a few days ago, and saw Rich Karlis, down there.
Uh-huh.
[lowering pitch] And I asked him a couple questions about, ah...some of the punting team this year, and I always thought about it, and, ah...if everything was gonna work out..
This is going out on such a lurch! You sound like Lurch, Raymond.
Well...whatever.
Thanks for your call. We just couldn't understand-
Yeah, I didn't think you were listening to me. I said, I changed over from AT&T to MCI. I know you represent US West, but, ah...you also represent AT&T, right?
That's wrong.
You just represent US West?
Yeah. But why...why, what happened?
Well, I changed over to MCI. Then I found out all of this pornography that MCI is supporting on TV, and I knocked 'em off. And I went back to AT&T, and now I found AT&T supports almost as much pornography as MCI. And, ah...I'm getting real upset with these outfits, that all they can do is support pornography on TV...for all of the kids to watch.
Uh...
[laughs] In other words, you like pornography, is that it?
Uh...I don't know.
[laughs]
I've never seen it.
You don't know whether or not you've watched pornography on the TV-I...I...
I've never...I've never seen it.
You've never seen it?
No, what is it?
Oh...man, if you don't know that, I don't know what I'm doin' talkin' to you, now.
I, ah...I really can't say either way, Henry. Ah...I, and, ah...
How old are you?
And you still don't know what pornography is? Well, I don't know what you can do about it, because you represent US West, and I don't know who US West advertises with.
Mmhmm.
But...
And you don't like what you're seeing, is that it?
I don't like what I'm seein'. I've got five year olds, two year old grandchild.
Uh-huh.
And they're brought up to the point where, we have to continually watch, ah...TV, every program that they start to turn on, we have to watch it. Because they even got pornography now...for little kids.
What?
That's where they're starting out at.
What?
Ah? Thats right.
What're you talking about, Henry?
[laughs]
For kids? For children?
Yes. For kids. For sexual activity among little children. For
nekkidness
. For
bare-breastedness
. For selling gays...and
lesbians
, on TV. Uh-uh. It's not right.
It's wrong, that's what you're saying?
No, it's very definitely wrong.
You're saying there's lesbian children?
The morality in this country is going to pots. And that's not what I fought World War 2 and Korea abo-about.
Uh-huh. Well, I uh...I feel your pain, Henry.
Okay.
Well, now, listen. You're bothering me right now. You tell me where you live because I don't know anybody by the name of Freddie.
I don't want to bother you or interfere, ma'am. I just want to get my turtle from you. Please?
Well, I don't have your turtle.
Ma'am, you do, though.
Where do I...
Please... please don't hang up on me, ma'am. Please don't be angry. Please?
Well, I can't help you because I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you let me in your yard? Just for a moment?
I can't... I... I have no key to that gate.
Please? I... he's... he's... I will find him. I will look for him.
Now, listen. I'm going to hang up and if you keep on calling me, I'm going to call the police.
Ma'am, please don't hang up on me.
...There's no such thing.
Well, no, the Goggle.
The Goggle?
Yeah.
Only thing I've ever heard of called a "Goggle" is for swimming.
(Pause)
I've never heard of one in electronics.
Well, no. Tandy make the Goggle.
No, sir.
Oh, maybe it is Realistic, then. Yeah, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm mistaken.
Same company. Uh, let me put ya on hold.
Have you got it in stock though?
Sir, I don't even know what you're talking about.
What's the problem here, uh... Sonny.
Well, sir, I think what the problem is, is that you're calling up... on a repeated basis asking for things that we don't carry to waste our time-
Such as?
These things you've been asking for today. The only thing that I carry that you've asked for today is a toggle switch.
You don't have a... Gigglio Goggle?
Sir, there's no such thing, and I think you're just messin' with me. We don't have the time, and if I could trace ya, I would have you charged with phone harassment.
I'm uh- this is a valid enquiry about your... 'bout your, uh... selections. That's all I'm doin'. I'm prepared to buy all the aformentioned items from ya.
Well, like I said, if you can bring in the equipment for us to look at, then we'll see what we have to match it up.
Alright.
But I have never heard of anything with the terms that you've used. You need to learn the correct terminology so that we can talk... with understanding, or please don't waste my time.
Okay... Um... Can you help me out with one final thing? I hope I'm not- If you've got just a moment?
Sure. Go ahead.
Umm... I was looking for a Nimbostratus Zackit.
A Nimbostratus Zackit?
That's correct.
So, you're looking for a cloud Zackit?
No, that's just the brand name. Uh... it's- it's- it's made by Tandy.
Sir, nimbostratus is a type of cloud.
Okay...
There's no such thing made by Tandy with that name.
(Pause)
It's- It's- It's a- It's- It's a device used-... made by Tandy to measure the... measure the f-... uh... the... the dickit.
Sir, you're wasting my time.

...microwave oven, a Forty-six inch Sony big screen television set, and finally, a $2000 cashier's check made out to you.
Oh wow.
Now, Mike. Knowing that one of those five awards is definitely yours, I'd like to say congratualations again. How does all that sound for a lot of great news today?
That sounds fantastic, sir.
Alright. Fantastic. Now, like any other promotion, there are only two things we would like to see you do for us while you're in the process of claiming your award. One is after you receive the award, take a picture of yourself with it. Send that back to us so we can use it for promotional purposes.
Ok.
Now, in approximately sixty days, the company will be calling you back with shipping instructions on one of those five fabulous awards.
Oh, wow.
Now second, like any other promotion we ask that you become a first time customer of ours by trying one of health and energy products. What we're using is a tested and proven vitamin and mineral program called Universal Life. Now Mike, do you currently take vitamins?
Yes.
Okay. Fantastic. Mike, these are the finest vitamins on the American market today. Of course, that is my opinion. I do take them, as well as my wife and children. Okay, that's five tablets a day. They supply most of your daily requirements from A to zinc. Now, these are non-allergenic and they are derived from all-natural products.
Ok.
It also has what's called the special sustained time release formula. Now, that ensures the maximum benefit throughout the day. Now, we have these boxed up in a twelve month supply. Through the promotion, Mike, you're receiving that vitamin program for exactly $698. In the same package is going to be your major award certificate. That officially guarantees one of the five major awards. Now Mike, have you ever won a major award?
Yeah.
OK, fantastic.
I won the lottery here.
Really?
Yeah.
Fabulous. Well, Mike, your good fortune is continuing. And I'll tell you what, if you get that Cadillac Coupe Deville, you better send me a bottle of champagne.
Okay.
OK. Now, will there be a problem getting a picture of you or a loved one with the award, correct?
Uh... There is something standing in my way.
OK... Uh... What would be the best time of day for us to deliver?
Umm... Could you talk to the Parochial Nimrod?
What's that?
Huh?
What are you talking about, Mike?
Well that's the thing that's standing in my way.
What's standing in your way?
Parochial Nimrod.
What's that?
I'm... I'm... I'm afraid I don't know how to handle it.
You don't know how to handle what?
The Parochial Nimrod.
[The sound of a slide whistle or recorder begins in the background]
Mike, I... What... What are you talking about?
What... What... How to handle this from here on.
You don't know how to handle what? Your-- [Drowned out by the high pitched background murmur of a recorder/slide whistle/unknown instrument].
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Well... the... Nimbostratus glick--
[Recorder/Slide whistle sound].
OK... Mike, what I need is the expiration date on the Visa.
Uh... Glickit
[Recorder sound].
Pardon me Mike?
Um... Zackit?
[Recorder sound]
What is the expiration date on your Visa?
Um.... Uhh... Ten Ninety-Two.
Ten of Ninety-Two? OK, now what I need... There's some... What's going on over there? I keep hearing... Seems like you're fading out or something.
It's that Nimrod.
[Recorder sound]
Your nimrod?
Yeah.
[Recorder sound]
OK. What I need is the long number that begins with a four. Read that to me slowly---
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
I need the long number that begins with a four, Mike.
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
Hello?
Yeah... OK, what I need is the long number that begins with a four.
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
Mike! What is going on over there?!
It's the Parochial Ramrod.
The Parochial Ramrod? What are you... What are you doing?
Well I'm trying to tell you, sir, that that's going to pose a problem.
That's the only problem is your parochial rimrod?
Yeah.
Are you taking medication, Mike?
Mmmm.
[Recorder sound]
Uhhh... Am I st-... Am I still eligible to be a recipient of these fine awards?
Yes. What I need is the long number that begins with a four.
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
Long number that begins with a four--
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
Long number that begins with a four. [Recorder sound]
Long-- What I need is the long number that begins with a four, Mike.
Garbled noises.
[Recorder sound]
Hello?
Hello?
Mike... Mike, where is your parochial rimroad? Where is that?
Umm... I've... I think I might've told you the wrong thing. It's umm... I think it's a rhinocerous dickrod.
[Recorder sound]
A Rhinocerous dickrod. [Recorder sound]
Mike, did you take your medication today?
[Recorder sound]
Mike, what I need, go grab your Visa-- [Recorder sound] Read us the long number that begins with a four.
[Recorder sound]
Hey, Mike.
[Pause]
Hello?
Hello. Mike...
Yeah?
Okay. Grab your Visa. Do you understand what's going on?
[Recorder sound]
Yeah.
Okay. Go grab your Visa.
[Recorder sound]
I've got it.
Okay, read me the long number that begins with a four.
Uhh.... Two-eight-seven-four-eight-three-six-
[Recorder sound]
-four.
[Recorder sound]
Look, Mike. Hello. Mike?
Yes.
Mike, my name is Frank Mathis, the promotional director. If you are not interested in taking part in this promotion, simply tell us you're not interested. This is a long distance call that we are paying for.....
Oh, I'm very interested, sir.
Either you're interested or you're not interested. If ya are interested, what we are gonna need to finish up the paperwork would be the account number beginning with a four on the Visa. D'ya have that information handy?
Yes I do, sir.
Ok. What we're gonna need is the long number that begins with a four-- [Recorder sound]
[Recorder sound continues]
OK.
Alright, do you have that there?
Yeah.
Ok, Mike. You have some sort of noise interference. I can't tell you what it is.
No I don't.
You don't what?
I don't have it.
You don't have what?
I don't have any interference.
Ok. You got the number begins with a four?
Yes.
Alright. Read that to me slowly.
Ok.
[Long pause]
Alright.
Ok.
You betcha.
Alright now... Now read the number that begins with a four.
You bet. Not a problem.
Read the number, Mike.
I can accommodate you there, sir.
Ok. Well, Mike. Again, if you're not interested, simply say you're not interested.
I'm very interested, sir. I'd have to be crazy to turn down these wonderful prizes.
Well again, Mike. Again... uh... We do not appreciate the ridicule. If you're not interested, just forget the sarcasm. All you got to do is simply say "I'm not interested." If ya are interested, than this is what we're gonna need.
Well uh... Do I have to provide a gridicular butt-rod?
If the bill was going on your number, then again I think you would be a little more serious with me.
I need a gridicular giraffe rod.
Mike, do you have any idea what's going on here? Do you have any idea what we're explaining to ya?
Ummm.... You mentioned something about a Gary Coleman nimrod.
Mike. Mike. [Recorder sound] Mike, are you under any kind of medication?
Huh?
Have you taken any medication today? If you're under some form of medication, I can't get back in touch with ya.
Can?
I can't. Ok, I'm not gonna, you know... I don't want ya going into a seizure or anything if you need to take any medication right now.
Umm....
If you call back. Sometime when you're a little more sedated.
Well I'm perfectly fine.
Ok. Well, again, then uh... then again we go over this round and round. All I'm gonna need if you're interested is the number that begins with the four.
Okay.
Now read me the number. This is the last time I'm going to ask ya, Mike. If you're not interested, tell me you're not interested. If you're interested right now, read me the number beginning with the four.
Okay... Um... It's in... It's in my saxophone and I have to dig it out.
Mike. Again, I mean, you can joke all you like. Alright? Okay?
What?
You can joke all you wanna joke. Again, that's completely up to you. It's not my award. If you don't wanna it, we will simply give it to someone else in your area.
Well my... It's... The card's in my saxophone.
Uh huh. Mike, do you have any clue how ridiculous you sound.
I don't think that's very nice.
Well, again, Mike. I mean, either, two second ago you have the card there, now you don't have the card.
I dropped it.
Oh, alright Mike. I'm gonna be honest with ya. If you had any clue to what your talking about or any idea what we're doing here for ya here today, I know you would've participated.
Well I'm trying to be a participant.
No, no, Mike. You're not trying. If you are interested, simply read the number beginning with the four. This is the way we bill the account for the amount of the charge.
I dropped it in my xylophone.
Oh, alright. Well, Mike, I suggest you do is get yourself some medical help. Okay?
What's the problem?
Okay, well again, I don't appre-- [Recorder sound] the sarcasm. If you're not interested simply tell us-- [Recorder sound]
I don't think that's very friendly.
Mike you're... I'm telling ya Mike, you're hysterical. And you know, I'd love to sit here and waste my valuable time on ya, but unfortunately I have a board meeting to go to. I do want you to know that you are turning the award down.
No I'm not.
Well, Mike. Again, unless you're going to cooperate with me here and give me the information I need in order to fill out the paperwork, I am going to have to let you go.
How about if I perform uh... tae-kwon-do on you?
Well, again, Mike. If that's what you feel you'd like to do, feel free. Okay? If you could perform your tae-kwon-do over the phone, again, I'd really love to see that.
[Pause]
Alright?
*Shut the fuck up Chico man.*
Sampled from the movie Wild Style
...unless you're speaking a foreign language I'm not familiar with, which is what it sounds like, I'm not familiar with it.
It's like...
What kind of device?
It's an oscilloscope-oriented device.
We don't sell oscilloscopes. You asked me about this six weeks ago and asked me about this.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
Must've been someone else.
We don't sell oscilloscopes.
It's not an oscilloscope, it's an oscilloscope-related product.
Right. We don't sell those things.
Um...how about...
Maybe the Tandy Corporation sells them under a different name for some other company.
How about
biblioduwangus
Never heard of it.
Hmm. How much is that retailing for, in stock?
Sir, you're wasting my time. I'm gonna hang up, and I'm not going to answer again the next time you call.
Don't hang up, sir! Give me one more...
Then get straight with me very quickly.
Okay. I'm interested in buying a PC this evening. That's my second reason for calling.
This is the same game we played last time...
I'm not playing games.
...and you keep hanging up when I go to get information.
I'm not hanging up...
You called a little while ago and asked me about the flutter rate for an LCD screen. There is no so much measurement on an LCD screen.
So there is no flutter on that unit, is that what you're telling me?
There is no "flutter rate" measurement on an LCD screen.
So it is a good unit then, right?
Goodbye.
And, there's nothing more important than what we're talking about. It's your money, it's your life! Let's go to Orlando, Florida.

Good evening, Doctor.
Good evening, Desmond.
Uhhhm.. phoning you tonight, regarding what I feel.. is the sure-fire--

'95. Now, is this--
A sure-fire? No, wait a minute. S
ure-fire
Yes, sir.
Cool! What is it?
And.. is this something that's going to insight the proverbial "riot in the streets"? I don't think so. Is this something that's gonna make a whole lot of money? Yes it is.
[downward pitch shift]
It involves the, uh, sale of mangoes, uh, from the Caribbean Islands, I'll be frank with you...
[muddled speech]
Wait a minute... [laughs] (His.. phone is sinking into...)
[high pitch]
Hello?
[laughs] ..You know-- He has one of those spy phones, one of those gadget phones..
Hello?
And, um.. Desmond is a crackpot. With a cool little knobby on his phone.
Dan, hi.
Hello there.
How are you sir?
Great, how are ya?
I'm good, thanks.
Ummm, I recently had someone come by my residence, and kind of pitch...sales pitch about uh...about Nougat...
Nou...nou?

What is it?
Nougat?
Uh-huh.
Ummm, some kind of edible, anyway...
Oh, ok. (Softly in background) This guy again.
Ummm...apparently...
We're on a roll tonight! Yes, we're getting the same guy over and over again, 1-800-634-7(recording end)
Safeway. This is Mike. Can I help you?
Yeah, do you have Rolo candies?
Yes.
I have a problem repeating things.
...Yeah?
So, do you have them?
I just said yes.
Rolo candies?
Right.
How much are they?
I don't know. I'd have to check.
Could you repeat that?
...What is this, some type of joke? Why do you want me to repeat everything?
Can you repeat the word Rolo?
Safeway. This is Mike. Can I help you?
Yeah, Mike, um... I just wanted you to bounce that word back to me to make sure I'm pronouncing it right; the word Rolo.
Why?
I... I... I know it's a little...
Do you want me to check on this product for you or not?
Just can you, um... can you say the word?
I'm not getting in... I don't play games. I'll check on this product if you want. Otherwise...
I... I am interested in the product and I'm prepared to buy it. I... and I realize this is a little unorthodox. If you would just...
I'm not providing you with a frigging thing, fella! Let me speak to your supervisor and we'll resolve this.
I didn't order any centipedes. I don't know who you are or what you're talking about.
Let me just talk to your supervisor, then. We don't need to continue this.
One moment. [hold] This is Desmond Stanford.
I don't know what it is you're talking about, so return the centipedes to the sender. How's that? Okay?
Did Noah explain to you we are authorized to throw the centipedes at you?
You're authorized to throw them at me, physically. [Laughs] What are you, playing games or what is this?
It's a prank! No, no. Hang up. Our caller ID'll get it.
Go ahead.
You will pay for your centipedes!
[Laughs] I didn't order any centipedes.
Or we will hurl the centipedes at you!
Oh, you'll hurl the centipedes if that's the appropriate term you wish to use.
[tone]
Ah, yes, I was interested in a wedge of mackerel.
Umm...this is the pharmacy.
Yes.
A wedge of mackerel?
Yes.
I don't know anything about a wedge of mackerel.
Um...I was interested in purchasing the item.

Yes...I was wondering if I could...if you sell a hunk of tortoise?
What? Who is this?
Uh...pardon?
Who is this?
Tanya Lubbock.
Tanya Lubbock...?
Yes.
What is that?
And I was interested in purchasing a hunk of...a hunk of tortoise.
[laughing] I'm sorry, I can't help with you with either one of those things.
You don't have either of those items available?
No, I don't. No.
Um...
[laughing] And I doubt I'll have anything else along that line you've been talking about.
Do you have any bottled
[tone]
...bottled squid potion?
No. [laughing] Is this a high school project?
Ah, no, I'm in postgraduate...
Are you recording this? [laughing]
Postgraduate college.
[laughing] Ah...
This is Mountain Truck Loading.
Yeah, I was interested in, ah...getting some stuff loaded, later on this afternoon.
What are you trying to move?
Uh...ah, a lot of rope we have.
Where...[tone] where's it going?
It's going ah...up in Limon. Up to Limon.
I can't do anything inside the state, sir.
Well, I mean, from there, we gotta pick up, ah...some cords, and we're going over...up to Nebraska.
Where are you going into Nebraska, then?
Ah, rope.
[tone]
Where?
We're moving rope.
What's that beepin'?
Ah...it's just some rope moving around. Uh...we're going to, uh...Ian. Ian, Nebraska.

Uh...Dan Limon. [tone] ...going to be problem moving rope?
What's the name of your company?
Ah...Rope...'s name.
Well, I can't do anything for you, sir.

Alright...Helian Ointment, Gorilla Ointment...I want to know who is the person's name, who made the order?
Julio Ointment.
Excuse me, I don't care about all the names of the ointments, sir. You...you and I have a communication problem. Whose name...is that shipment addressed to? Who is the receiver?
That would be you, at this...
No, it wouldn't be me, because I do not place orders.
How about if you...if I hurled the ointment at you? How does that sound?
Excuse me, you are very, very...obnoxious...person. And if this is...one of these crank...telephone sales call, forget it. I'm very familiar with boiler room operations.
How about if I squirted the ointment at you, madam?
Uh...excuse me, sir? Go to hell and have a nice day.
Ah, yes, madam?...I am the supervisor of ointment, and believe...
What's the name of your company?
Pardon?
What's the name of your company?
Ah...why must we divulge something so trivial, madam?
It isn't trivial, sir; when I am involving the Aurora Police Department.
Into what? I do not under-
Into harassment, that is what.
I do not understand your ointment, to be frank with you.
Excuse me, sir? Nobody ordered ointment. You cannot give me the name of the receiver, you cannot give me the date that the shipment was placed, you won't divulge the name of this boiler room telemarketing
ripoff
company.
Look at, ma'am...look at, look at our perspective...
I'm looking at your perspective!
YOU are going to be tumbling through ointment
very
shortly, how does that grab you?
Oh, go to hell with that ointment shit, okay? I do not have the time, or the patience...or the inclination or desire to continue this conversation. And don't call this number again.
But, madam!
I don't care!
Hello?
Yes, umm...can I get some bird putty from you?
We, no, we just have sausage.
How much would that cost?
I can't get it for you.
Why no-t?
You start again? I'm gonna call the police on you, you know that?
What's the problem?
Problem? Because you call up before and I remember you voice.
You remem...
You go to hell!
Hello?
Yes, sir. I wanted to get some liquid sausage.
Ah...stick-a it in you ass.
What?
Stick-a it in you ass. Stick-a it in you ass.
Look...I don't know where you come from, but that is not how we practice business in this country, sir. Yeah, can I get some buttock sausage?
You start again?
What?
You start again.
What is the problem?
The problem is, I told you the stuff you want, we no carry it.
Like what?
Why...like what, like you started last time! I have the phone trace, the police then they gonna connect you pretty soon. You better leave me alone! Because I told you we no have the stuff, why you insist we have it, and how much it is? If we no carry, how many times I have to tell you?
But do you have...
Don't you understand English?!
But do you have chipmunk sausage, ma'am?
You-you have chipmunk mu-...sausage, sir. You wanna-you wanna play around, go play around with your kind!
Or how about porpoise jerky?
You start again? Please...don't bother me.
Look, I need some...some porpoise jerky made.
I don't have it!
You don't have...
I don't know how to make it, because we sell Italian sausage.
You don't have what?
Yeah, I don't have
SHIT!
[long string of Italian]
Look...
'Kay?
[speaking in Italian]
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah...I don't know what you're saying, but I...I just needed some condor...sausage?
Yeah, we got it, come over!
You have what?
Every-thing.
Do you have testicle, sausage?
We got a testicle!
You do?
Yeah!
How much are they?
For how many?
Huh?
How many?
Each! Each testicle! Are you gay, what?
Yo, Jake, you there? Alright, Alan in Golden, you're on KBIG Radio. Couple of open lines, 607-29...
I suppose the voice of reason threw him off?
Probably. Hello, Alan.
Howdy.
Howdy.
I wanted to talk to you a little bit about Gugliotta this afternoon.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Now, how did you...how did you guys feel about when when Gugliotta intercepted that bladder, the other day?
Wh-I'm sorry, what did you say?
What?
From, uh...from Rulon Jones?
Wh-what are we talking about here?
Tom Gugliotta
and
Rulon Jones
Yeah, he intercepted that spleen or something, or...?
You're, you're...ah, you've left us in the dark. Better...give this guy what he's got coming. The real thing.
How did you guys-
[bomb SFX]
[laughing]
That's what he had coming.
[laughing]
Gugliotta
...that guy! Ah, I'll tell you! You know what? I think he's had some Kentucky Tavern. That hasn't been on the market...in a long time.
He might've, he might've...you're not...you can't say that.
Okay, I'll say Calvert's instead. I'm sorry, I apologize...

Hello?
Yeah, I need to talk to Gomez, and stuff.
This is not the Gomez residence.
No...
This number has been ours for over a year, but we get Gomez calls all the time.
No, I am Gomez, I said.
You are?
I, yes.
Yes?
I need to know what my call activity has been over the last 15 or 18 months.
Well, why do you need to know that? Why do I have your telephone number and I keep getting all your phone calls?
Ah...that's exactly why I'm calling. I, frankly I don't like the attitude that you've been giving my, ah...my customers, you know.
Ah...excuse me, this is my residence. All I said was...
But this is my business, you know.
No one ever said this was a business, they call, they ask for Gomez.
Ah...
So-and-so Gomez, by a ladies' name, usually.
Don't...don't talk to me about my business, young lady. Okay? That's what I have to say to you.
Hello?
Hello, ma'am?
Mr. Gomez, if you have a problem because people are calling me for you, you need to call the phone company.
Ah...
...which is what I intend to do as soon as I hang up the phone.
You know, look...you give me problems about my business.
Ah...no. Excuse me, I don't give you problems about your business. When people call here, they ask for Ruben Gomez or some other woman, and I say 'I'm sorry, this isn't the Gomez residence.' That's my answer.
Elas-
I don't know what you do for a business. I could care less.
I deal with Elastico Gomez, ma'am.
(Note: perhaps "Elastical Gomez"?)
I don't know that name.
What is your name, you know?
What's the difference? This is my phone number, I don't need to give you any information, this is my number that was assigned to me more than a year ago.
You know, I have many people in my line of work, you know.
So?
I'm a very wealthy man.
I don't care.
Very powerful man, very...
I don't care.
...extravagant man.
I don't care. All I'm saying is we get phone calls all the time for Gomez, we always say '
this isn't the Gomez residence
.' We've had this number for about a year now, and I don't know who this Mr. Gomez is...
What do you want, jewels?
I don't want nothing! Leave me alone.
...wealth? What do you want?
I want you off my phone. I don't want you to call me again, either.
Would you like jewels, madam?
I...listen, if you don't get off the phone and you call me again, I'm gonna call the police.
Jewels are my business.
I don't care.
I'm an extravagant man, that's what I am...
I don't care.
...that's my business, right there.
I don't care.
Now, look...do you want wealth?
This is not your phone number...what do you want me to do when people call?
Travel the world? What do you want?
I don't want anything, I just don't want you to call me. If people call for you, I just say this is the wrong number.
I've been all around the world, you know.
I could care less.
I'm a very, very...ah, elegant man.
What do you want from me? What do you want me to do, when people call?
I would like you to come work for my business.
Yeah, right...I'm...I, I'm hanging up, and I don't wish for you to call back.
Look...I am Gomez, okay?
I don't care.
That's who I am. What do you want, jewels, gold? What do you want?
Goodbye.
Notes
Edit
No less than two American post-rock bands have derived song titles from LPC's "Gomez": The Mercury Program have a song called "You Give Me Problems About My Business" and The Fucking Am have one called "Elastico Gomez".
Now, what are you gonna bring?
I'm gonna bring your spleen to ya.

Spleen. Mmhmm. That's right. What's the

What's the best time to bring your spleen to ya?

No...
Put your old man on the line, would ya? Appreciate that.
He's not here!

What are you "damn" bringing, a bladder?
[inhale] That's right. Damn right! [exhale]
He says he's "damn" bringing a bladder...
Ah, hello? Uh...

Sir...how many people?
What're you talking about?
You need a room? This is a motel.
Yeah...I need something to prevent coaxial flutter.
Coaxial flutter? Never heard of that...
What do you got on that?
...that terminology. Ah...
Getting like, some perpendicular crosstalk on the unit.
Okay...on a, on a TV?
As I mentioned earlier, I got some...a little coaxial flutter on my unit.
Okay, and as I said, I'm not familiar with that term. Is it a video unit, or what...what type of unit is it?
I got like, a...some perpendicular crosstalk on there.
Is it on a video unit?
What's the wow ratio on that?
The wow ratio?
Yes, sir. On that bandwidth.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What...what's up man, that's...just wanna lay it on the line for you, my friend.
Well...but, you're not making any sense.
Why no-t?
Well, first off, when I ask a question, you don't answer it. Are you talking about a video system, an audio system, what are you talking about?
Okay...backing up my friend, I...I mentioned I've got some coaxial flutter on my unit.
And, again...for the third time, I said I'm not familiar with that term. What is the unit?
It's a...perpendicular crosstalk.
Bernie in Brighton, you're on KBIG 1090 with Irv and Joe.
Isn't Pocahontas the school mascot?
[laughs] I don't think so! Ernie, how are ya?
Pretty good, thanks. Evenin'. Uh...I just wanted to share with you, maybe; a conversation I had with Red Miller, recently.
With who?
Red Miller.
Go ahead, Ernie.
Red Miller, yeah. Go ahead, Ernie.
I had spoken to him in the past about Mark Gastineau, and the fact that.. you know, that man knew what was going on at both sides of the football. Uh...we started talking about Otis King, and then...and then he...[random warbling]
Got a real bad connection, here. Ernie, please call back...terrible connection. Let's go right to the phones...
I don't give a shit what you think.
It's... I'm not paying it; period. I don't know what else to tell you. I did not order putty. You go get yourself some lawyers and I'll go get mine and we'll see who ordered putty. You try to drop off eight hundred dollars' worth of putty here and we'll see what happens.
I... I don't even know what putty is. Why would I order some? I work in a video game store.
I did not order putty. I don't have eight hundred dollars. I don't even know what putty is.
Um, apparently you just changed your mind on a product, but in this...
No, I didn't just change my mind on the product. I did not order putty.
In this case, though, it's, uh... it's a bit more serious because you're dealing...
Well, fine.
You're dealing with a perishable here.
Good. It's not mine. You do what you guys need to. I... I'll be more than happy to go to court over it.

How much would that cost for me to do that?
Aweeeah! Owaaah! Euuuah!

Actually, I wanted to trade something for it.

Oh, it's just like...you're this little dude, and you have to shoot all these aliens...and stuff. and this wizard dude...
You have to shoot a wizard, dude?

Yeah.
You bet. You bet it does. Yeah, I wanted to trade something for it...I've got...putty?
Welll...you're going to talk to...someone else about the...money part.
It's...putty, not money, though...
Hello?
Uh...yeah, I wanted to trade something for Wizard of Wor?
Uh...[laughs]...what?
I wanted to trade, um...some like, putty?
Putty?
Uh-huh. If that's acceptable.
I...don't know that I'd have any use for putty. What kind of putty are you talking about?
Chewable.
Nah, I don't think I've have any use for that.
How about a zebra?
A zebra? Nah...I'd have to clean up after him.
Huh?
I would have to clean up after him. [laughs]
Um...how about like, something like bronze statuary, or hummels, or...any pottery, or...?
Well...that's why I'm trying to sell all this, because I'm trying to get...
I have some souvenir spoons, or...um...some, you know, rugs and stuff..
Well, no, I'm really trying to...eliminate some stuff around the house, that's why...I...make more room, I don't...really need to fill it up with anything else.
How about wrought iron? Or teak?
Ah...don't really need any of that, either.
How about a '67 Mercury Cougar?
A '67 Mercury Cougar?
Mm-hmm.
Does it run?
Yes.
What shape is it in?
Umm...it's missing all four doors, and...all the, all the wheels and tires. And windows.
Mmm...no, I don't think I'd have any use for that, then.
Can I come over and play it?
Mmm...
I mean...just for a quarter, each time?
Mmm...nah.
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Yeah, we keep getting cut off here, I apologize about that...

Okay, what is your inquiry? And you'd better make it fast, I don't want any screwing around.
What
do you want?
Okay, well...first of all, what gives you carte blanche to take this attitude with me, with that tonality, over the phone?
Uh...again, don't call here again, or I'm going to put you under the U.S. West tracking system.
Okay, let me give you my inquiry...
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Okay. Well, let's get serious, now. I've got a job I need done, and I need it done within 30 days time. Is that timeframe...
We're not interested in doing business with you, but I appreciate your call...
Well...why not?
...put you under the tracking system if you complain...I gotta find a way to do it though, first of all, so you'll have to call again.
But...
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
You need some tracking work done, is that what I understand?
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Hi, this is Douglas from Best...Surfaces? I was trying to do, uh...an employee verification check?
Uh, sir...this call is going to be traced. You've already been traced once, it will be traced two more times, and then you'll be having the police cutting you off from U.S. West and Bell.
Forgive me? I...
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Yes, sir, what's your mailing address?
Still here.
Still here.
Still here.
That was the wrong number. I'm not going to put you...report you to U.S. West again...
[incredulous]
Wha...
You better stop calling.
Sir, I think you're the one violating the codes, here...
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Yeah, hang up again. Go ahead and hang up.
Good afternoon, Underbakke & Associates, may I help you?
Ah, yes...I'd like to talk about the validity of, uh...Collette...ah, Gagagucci. Is it too late in the day for that, or...?
Yes sir, it sure is, but I appreciate-
I don't know what you mean. We don't have anything like that.
Like what?
Like a puffy twinkie. If you want twinkies, you can talk to the grocery manager.
[Incomprehensible/edited out]
Twinkie Glitton?
Right.
Who are you looking for?
I just stated it.
Who are you looking for? Twinkie Glitton? I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
[Clearing of throat] I'm afraid not. Listen, if you'll just... if you'll just bear with me. Um, I'm Twinkie Glitton.
Mmhmm. That still don't say who you're looking for.
How does that grab you though? You gotta admit, that, you know, that flattered you a little bit though.
Now, who is this, and who are you looking for?
Uhh... Poncho Herrera.
Uh. Sorry. Bye.
Wait a minute.
What?
You gotta tell me something first.
Tell you what?
Ummm... Did Emilio Glitton...
Emilio Glitton?
Did he get that puffy twinkie?
[Phone Hangup]
Yes?
Yeah. Um, I was calling for Twinkie Gorilla.
I think you have the wrong number, my dear.
No I don't. Listen, if you'll just see it my way for a minute.
I really don't have time to play games on the phone.
I'm not playing with you here.
There's no such person... living here, so...
He said he was going to be there in your yard though about this hour.
[Sigh] Wha- what yard?
In your yard though. I mean, you gotta, you gotta, you know...
Oh, ok. So he said he'd be in this yard and you got the number from him?
Yeah.
Am I correct?
That's right.
Ahh... No, I'm sorry.
Err... From Mueller...
Excuse me?
Uh. Mueller Cetera.
Miller? Mueller? I'm sorry. Mueller, I've never even heard of it.
Listen...
Never even heard of it.
Come on.
No, you come on.
You gotta admit that was flattering though, wasn't it?
No it wasn't. It was... Actually it was obnoxious.
Oh ok. But look...
Tell me who this is first. And we'll talk, and see how you are.
[Possibly a new call. Certainly a new person on the other end]
I need to talk to, to umm... Gorilla Romero.
[Repeated effect that kind of sounds like "huh"]
Well I think you're on drugs or something, buddy. There ain't nobody that lives around here by that name.
Listen, I don't think you're being honest with me partner.
Well, you wanna come down here and find out, or what?
Uh...I don't know, I never heard of you guys.
Who? What?
I never even heard of you guys.
What?
Lesbian Thrash [tone]...or whatever?
Yeah? You into that, or something? What are you talking about, dude?
What?
What are you talking about, anyway?
I never heard of your band, man.
Which band?
Aren't you in a band?
Yeah.
[tone]
Did you get...
Hello?
Hello?
Do I need to rip off your face?
Uh...dude, I gotta let you go, man.
What for, dude?
'Cause I told you, I got a student in guitar lessons right now.
Hey, can you play the saxophone for us tonight?
[tone] [laughs] Yeah, I gotta let you go...
Hey, wait, seriously...let me ask you one more question, 'kay?
Alright.
We're forming a new band...
Uh-huh.
...and, could you...is there any way you can join that? We're called Saxophone Lesbian.
No, I can't.
Why not, dude?
[tone]
'Cause I got a killer band.
Huh? You want me to kill your band? I could do that with my fists alone, buddy.
And that'd be your last mistake, mister.
Oh, yeah? Uh...you never heard of Bobby though, huh?
No, why?
[downward pitch shift] He's a fuckin' [tone] killer drummer, man.
I'm gonna drum all over his lip...my feet.
Really? Well....
How's that sound, buddy?
That sounds just great, man.
You cross me on this...that's your last mistake, mister.
Yeah, but would you play thrash tambourine for us?
Tonight?
Yeah.
Alright...
We'll give you fifty bucks.
Say what?
We'll give you fifty bucks.
Oh, yeah?
[tone]
It's on Broadway...yeah.
Uh...nah, I don't think so, bud.
Mmm..do I need to bring my cleats to your face...once I kick you, or what?
I think you should just...uh...I don't know, find somebody else, man.
Who's this?
This is Hugh.
Who?
Hugh.
Hugh?
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?
Play the cymbal.
Play a cymbal?
Yeah...For our band Lesbian Mummy.
(Chuckle) Is this a joke man?
No man, come on bud. Hundred bucks dude, for the cymbal.
A hundred bucks for a cymbal?
Yeah.
I don't get what you're tryin' to tell me.
You're either gonna play the cymbal on stage for us tonight, or I'm gonna take a cymbal to your lip tomorrow.
How'd you get my name?
Huh? That's not important.
Yeah it is.
No it isn't. I'm gonna bring over a cymbal and take it to your face.
Your gonna get...a cymbal?
Yeah.
And I'm gonna play it?
No. I'm gonna take it to your face in a minute.
You're gonna take it to my face?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna play the cymbal off your face, how's that sound?
Your gonna play the cymbal off my face?
Yeah.
Anytime motherfucker. (Track end)
NOTE: I believe the below previously transcribed text to be incorrect, but perhaps it is part of a different track?
What the fuck's your deal, man? What are you so fuckin' pissed off about?
Ah...fuck you, you pussy.
Fuckin' pussy.
You gonna play the cymbal off my face?
Any [tone] motherfucker. Come on down.
You talk pretty fuckin' tough, man.
Scrotum sausage.
Listen, you son of a bitch...get your ass over here, and I'll cut your scrotum like you never thought before...I'll blow your ass with a sawed-off shotgun, you
bastard
I hate to be rude to you, buddy, but you got the wrong number.
Yeah, I don't want any putty, buddy.
I did not make any order. I don't know what buttock putty is and I don't want it. I don't have a building and I think you got the wrong number.
And it's...
Bring it right here, pal! Don't mess around! You got it?
I just need to know what's the best time of day to deliver on it.
I'll tell you where to deliver it... 'cept my daughter's in the room.
Drugs or what? How come you can't answer a simple question?
I'm the one asking the questions here.
I'm the one asking the questions.
Well, no you... no you aren't. That's where you're wrong again. Wh... but what part of the... what part of the, you know, establishment does this go to?
I'm gonna tell you... again. You've got the wrong number. You've written it down wrong. You've done something wrong. They gave you wrong number. I don't know who you are. I don't want your putty. I don't know what putty is used for. I don't use putty.
It's magnetic buttock putty.
I have not a clue what you do with magnetic buttock putty.
Well, you must... you must...
And you can use it for your buttocks as far as I'm concerned.
I don't buy anything from an Indonesian buttock center.
We got sausage...if you need a sausage, you come and get it, and you cook yourself.
What kind of sausage?
Donkey sausage.
Donkey sausage?
[spoken Italian in background]
Hello? Put that lady back on.
Listen, please...don't be bothering the lady. We don't have no donkey sausage.
Squid putty. That sounds very good. Just show your face over here.
Um...I'm not sure. You're looking for an artwork by the name of, ah..."Al Putty"?
Uh-huh.
And the artist is Laverne Beasley?
Right.
Uh...that doesn't sound familiar. It's not a poster? What...is it a lithograph, or something? Do you know what kind...type of medium it is?
...wanted to get, uh...some food?
We're not open today, honey. I'm at home in bed, I'll be there tomorrow.
Do you have ow...do you serve owl?
Owl
? We serve soul food. Porkchops, and steak, and neckbones, and pigs' feet...and stuff like that.
Uh...are you gonna eat, or not?...uh...do you like soul food?
Hello?
Hello.
Hey, this is Rusty Savage, your neighbor.
What number are you calling,
dude
Ah, that ain't important, brother. I saw you messing with my levers and pivots, and I'd like 'em back.
Don't get too personal!
Tell me this ain't gonna happen again, partner.
Hey, you ain't my partner, so I don't know who the fuck you are, so...
How about if I took it out on your face with my feet?
Come on, dude.
Hello?
Hello?
It's Buddy Gripple callin'.
Yeah?
And, uh... you know, what is the problem? What is the ordeal here?
Well, I don't know who you're looking for or what your problem is, but it's not with me and not at this number.
I'm a... friend of Rusty Savage's.
That's fine. I don't know who Rusty Savage is either.
And I saw you fussin' with my shed and my levers.
I don't know what your lever is or what shed you're talking about.
You, uh... I saw you grab hold of that pivotal lever down there and I need it back.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And I need you to promise me this ain't gonna happen again, partner.
I ain't gonna promise you nothin'. Now if you call here again, you'll be reported. Do you understand that?
I'll promise you a bandagin' if you don't provide it at once, partner. You're gonna hand it over.
Well, I'm real busy here, so...um, I guess, if you don't really have a...legitimate question, I have to go.
I asked you about the Zingers.
Yeah, Zingers...I have no clue what a Zinger is, so...nobody told me about a Zinger, so...I can't help you on that.
I need to talk to Herschel Klinger.
Uh...they're not here.
They're a shopper.
Yeah, no, they're not a shopper. Not here today, they're not. I gotta go. Well, thanks for calling, have a nice day...
[reversed speech]
I'm look-
Seven...
Huh?
Seven.
[reversed] I don't know who you're looking
for
Huh?
Go get me a Jolly Rancher real fast, lady.
Go on. Run.
What?
Go grab me
[tone]
one of those suckers out of the ashtray.
Did you get it?
What?
Did you get it
Yeah.
Will you lick it?
Shut
up
[laughing] ...that girl's problem?
Mullen High School, may I help you?
Hi, do you have a...gym teacher?
Pardon me?
Do you have a gym teacher?
A gym teacher?
Uh-huh.
Well...yeah, we have all kinds of gym teachers.
Can I talk to him?
No, I'm sorry. They are all gone for the day.
Ah...ma'am?
[tone]
Yes?
Can I enroll my...my son there?
Well....I don't know about this year, but, ah...you can do that for next year.
Mmm...I need to get him in right away.
Well, I'll tell you what. Brother Marvin would be in charge, because [tone] he's in charge of admissions.
Ah, no...I don't have any brothers. Did...
Pardon me?
I don't have any brothers, neither does my son, he's an only child. I just need to enroll him, please, if that'd be feasible.
Sir, what I'm saying is, Brother Marvin is in charge of admissions.
Uh-huh. I don't...I don't have any...admissions to make to you. I
admit
I would like my son to go there. Uh...when...what kind of lunches do you serve for the kids?
Well, we have cold lunches.
Mm-hmm. Okay, so what time should I have him there for first [tone] hour tomorrow?
Your son?
Yes.
Oh, sir...you can't bring him in. You have to have him enrolled and registered.
Oh, he is...oh, he can do that tomorrow during lunch, or something. Ah, when...does the class start?
[tone]
I'm sorry, sir; but you need to speak with Brother Marvin first.
Um...does he give ointment to the kids?
Yes...he would, uh-huh... but you have to speak to him, first.
Oh, he does deal with ointment, then?
[tone]
I will have to have him give you a call.
Uh-huh. Umm...do the...
Could I have your number, and I'll have him call you.
Do the...let me ask...okay, can I ask you one more question?
Sure.
Um...do you say you have cold lunches? Do the kids get ointment sandwiches?
[tone]
What kind of sandwiches?
Ointment.
No, I don't believe so, I never heard of that.
Ma'am could-
Bye.
Could you conceal nipper and embroider?
Goodbye.
Ma'am...could you...could you conceal Nipper in embroidery?
No. I'm sorry, goodbye.
Wait, ma'am... wait a second, one second.
What?
[tone]
I need embroidery done.
Would you embroider my foot?
Um...I'm sorry, you got...wh-...I'm gonna hang up, and the right one call me back, alright?
Wait a second...
Ma'am...
Why don't you just hang on the line and hang up on the wrong one?
Well, I'm sorry. Both of you will have to call me back. [tone] Buh-bye.
[laughs]
[echo] This'll be gay, I'm sure...Hey.
Yeah?
[whistles]
Grandpa Tweedles, this is John.
Can I speak to Grandpa Tweedle?
Speaking.
How you doing?
Pretty good, how are you [tone] doing?
Not bad. Are you the clown?
Yeah.
I needed a clo- I needed a clown.
Okay?
We have a party coming up this weekend for 1,500 first graders.
No, I don't think so.
What?
I'm not gonna throw cake on kids, or punch... [laughing]
Well, I don't want you to punch them, I want you to spill punch on them.
Yeah...no. Not interested.
Well, I'd pay you a lot of
[tone]
money, we've got a big budget for this, sir.
Yeah...no, I don't think so. Thanks for calling, though.
Wait...sir?
Yeah?
Um...we have another party for, um...for wax sculptures? If you could do some entertainment there?
[tone]
No, I don't think so. We'll see you.
Well, can I...sir?
"Ooh, if I could..." [laughs] ... could go,
"Ooh, if I could get you!"
[laughs]
... um, usually we only board cats and dogs.
Um, could you harbor my stick insect?
Oh, I thought this was an animal. See, the problem is we don't keep insects.
But I've trained him to speak.
[laughs] You're a nutty nut. [tone] I think you're...a nutso. Aren't ya?
Ready...ready to meet up with my fist, 'w?
Who are you?
Bonecrusher Sm-
[tone]

Bo-who?

Bonecrusher Smith...
Yeah.
You wish you was!
...sound to you?
Pardon me?
[tone]
How does that sound to you?
How does what sound to me?
Me coming out, kicking my boots around.
For what?
To get what I need.
Well, if we don't have it, sir, we can't help you. [tone] Who am I speaking to?
Huh?
Who am I speaking to?
This is DeFranco.
Yeah? And why should we get you boots, sir?
Cause you don't...I need my elastic, or you're gonna meet up with my boot. That's the bottom line.
What boots are you talking about?
The boots on my foot.
Yeah, what's wrong with them?
They're gonna meet up with your lip.
Yeah?
I just need my elastic outfit, if I could.
The elastic outfit?
Yeah.
For what?
For me to wear.
...well..I don't know what kind of outfit you're [tone] talking about, you're welcome to call one of our stores and see if they have it.
I need an elastic purchase, though; is what I needed to make. And if you don't provide it, you're gonna meet up with my fist!
Fine. Sounds like a winner.
Get...get the trace going
. Okay. Keep talking.
Shut up.
Keep-
You..wha..need...do what?
I need to bring you your nectarines.
Oh...that's okay...
What?
I said, that's okay. Who am I talking to?
To, ah...Nipper.
You...
[tone]
...no...you have the wrong number.
No, I need to bring you your nectarine.
Just...just a moment.
Huh?
Hello?
Hi, I need to bring the nectarines to you.
Nectarine? [tone]
Yes.
Oh, sorry, bud...you...I think you do have the wrong number.
(Oh, stop acting like an idiot, will ya?)
Make a payment, or what?
We'll see when you get here.
I need to know how you're paying...
We'll see when you get here!
You're gonna see...
Come on down. How soon are you gonna be here, bud?
Ten minutes.
We'll be here.
You..my fists are gonna be ready.
That's cool.
And I don't think you're gonna like it!
I don't think you're gonna like what's gonna come [tone] back, bud!
What're you talkin'? I'm talking about whippin' you upside your chin, how's that sound?
Come on.
(Come on.)
I said, come on!
You get on down here and you back it up now, bud
. And I'll see you in ten minutes, asshole. Name was that ordered these?
You made the order.
Yeah, what's my name, then?
It's on the package.
Okay, then look at the package and tell me.
I don't got it handy, it's in the truck. But when can I bring it to you, that's all I need left, and how are you gonna pay, that's all these things I need to ask.
Go get the [tone] package off the truck, man.
No.
Yeah.
If I do it, I'm just gonna drop it on you, with my fists. That's the...that's the bottom line, right there
Stop the bullshit, man! Go get the package! You're just being an asshole!
No, my fists'll do the talking for me pretty fast.
[tone]
That's cool.

Hi I wanted to uh, revel in the excitement of Tandy.
Ok...
So where- where could I get involved with something like that?
Where can you revel in the excitement of Tandy?
Uh-huh.
Um...off our homepage at www.radioshack.com
Ok...th- is i-, is it, is it palpable? The feeling?
I'm sorry?
Um..so what's-,what's new, what's hot this summer for uh, product?
Wireless phones.
kay, those are popular...
Mmm-hm, yeah, you might wanna get me off that speakerphone there that feedback might go away...is that a speakerphone that I'm on?
Oh, ok then lemme try that.
If you're try'na vape-, uh hav- add
vapor
, to the retro
vaporized
nebulizer, then it's not gonna-
[audio from Law & Order Season 7, Episode 15]
The morning after Miss Ellison was killed...
It's not gonna clear...
I dunno.
...news about you checking Eddie Newman's phone records.
Might wanna call another RadioShack, they might know.
...over...You told me he was not a suspect...I asked you a straightforward question...
Okay?
...I deserve an honest answer.
I'm not aware of any such uh, device...that'll
moisturize
an
unstable
nebulizer...
D- you know you're talking to RadioShack right now?
Let alone
retro
-nebulize...I'm never heard of any kind of
retro
nebulization
You call up on the phone and you talk shit.
I ain't talkin shit, I'm talkin'
whip
But you ain't bad...so you can talk shit on the phone. If you ever came up to me with a whip, I'd fuck your ass up so hard, you wouldn't get out the hospital for about three months, dude...four months, dude...see-
Electronics Boutique, where you can trade in your old games, this is Jeff.
[sigh] Jeff, how ya doin'?
Pretty good.
Um...I need to make uh...[echoing] coupla upgrades...it's a, it's a...digital repressor
Hmmm. Oh, oh, oh is your- you-
Simulator
-looking to upgrade the entire machine?
Yeah [ye- echoes, increases in pitch]...pretty much from-from the ground up, ya know?
M'kay. Uuum, we actually mainly-
Reason I ask, no, reason I ask was cuz the guy at the Sunglass Hut was talkin' 'bout you [ya- echoes, decreases in pitch], so I'd probably-I'd prolly check it out.
Uh-huh.
Reason being, ya know, is just cuz of that [echoes and increases in pitch].
Yeah.
[whispered] Some.
Um, we mostly deal with software. Um, if you want to upgrade the entire system-
It was during a chess...session. [ow- echoes, decreases in pitch] He was-it was
digital
chess...
Oh, okay. Uuum...
Chess! [ch- echoes, increases in pitch, slowly decreases in pitch]
Let's see here...yeah, uh...we-we have, uh, mainly software. If you're looking for the-
Yeah...
Hardware stuff, uh, I'd say probably, uh-
Kay [echoes, decreases in pitch.]
CompUSA would probably be the best place to look, for it...
Kay, cuz I thought so ["cuz I thought so" echoes, increases in pitch]. But that repressor...how much repression is there in something like that?
Uh, for-what was it?
For the, uh, digital to analog repercussions?
[deep breath] To tell ya the truth, I-I do not know, I'm-I'm not exactly familiar with, uh, the newer, uh, pretty much any of the word processors on the market, um-
Right. That's true ["that's true" echoes loudly] because it's just one of those things-
Yeah, um-
with nebulizing, ya know ["one of those things" repeats in a very low pitch]? Once something's nebulized-
Yeah. [whispered] Oh, God. CompUSA-
[gibberish in extremely low pitch ]
Once something's-
Is probably the best place to look.
Once something's rendered ["once something's nebulized" repeats in a very high pitch]-rendered
being
nebulized ["once something's rendered" repeats in a very high pitch] is what I'm talking about.
What was it?
["once something's rendered," "is what I'm talking about" repeats in a very high pitch] Once I've rendered something nebu
lized
...I've rea
lized
[-ized repeats in a lower pitch]...
Nebulized...?
["I've real-" repeats in a very low pitch]
That...the repression of the simulated ["I've real-" repeats] nebulizer ["the repression of the simulated nebulizer" repeats, increasing in pitch] is a repression ["is a repression" repeats, decreasing in pitch]...of the digital chess session ["of the digital chess session" repeats in a lowered pitch].
Mhm.
And that's-that's where things kinda interfered, cross-pollinated, different things took place. [gibberish in high pitch repeats increasing in pitch] Yeah so, more or less. Where you guys stand on something like that?
Um-
C'mon, talk to me a little bit. Appreciate your time.
It-
Now, I certainly do appreciate it, certainly do ["now I certainly do" repeats in extremely low pitch]. Now,
let me have it now as a representation...of that nebulized simulation ["mulat" repeats, decreasing in pitch].
Uh, so you're-I mean, we have some chess software, but not a who-whole lot of it.
Sure ya do.
We have, like the chetmast-chessmaster stuff, but we don't carry any of the, uh, the physical chessboards.
["sure ya do" echoes in an increasingly very high pitch] Are they simulated?
Um-
["are they sim" repeats in a very low pitch]
Well, you-you can do the-
I can't understand.
Against the computer...
I can't really understand.
...to play the other side...
Yeah ["MMMM" sound plays], wha-.
What?
Twist 'n Shout.
Sup, man?
What's happenin'?
Yeah...can I talk to, like...a lyricist, man?
To
one?
Right, bro...
Yeah...I don't think there's anybody here, right now.
Well, this is a music store, right?
Yeah.
Alright...do you got a minute, to check out some...some rhymes, man?
Yeah.
Right, that's cool...I got a few people down here.
Okay.
So, I'm gonna start rhyming pretty quick...I needed someone who...knows how to rhyme, man.
Knows how to rhyme?
Right.
[laughs] I don't know, man...there's not really anybody here like that.
Hmm...you into doo-wop, man?
Mildly...I dig it, y'know...
It's fat, bro. Fuh-in' fat, doo...

Hey...hello?

Not much, how're you doin'?
I'm gettin' ready to

Check this...check this stuff out, one time...
Alright...

[laughing]
I feel it, brother!
[an eight second din of indeterminate sounds]
Nice...
So you down? You in or out, man?
Ah, I'm in!
With the sounds, right?
I'm in with the sounds...the sounds you can provide! What else do got? What else do you have?
I don't like the sound of your voice, young man! Do you understand?
[intense feedback]
[mimicking accent] "Do you understand?" No, I don't understand...
[feedback]
This is a record store, bro! We don't do that no more.
Well, how much do you charge, man? It's...I just wanted a trim, y'know...like a taper...
Bro...we don't do that no more.
Look, check it out...you're in Beauty, man. That's what it says, and you're in my neighborhood. I live two...

Ummm... This is just an all-girls strip club. Um... This isn't a Chipendales or a male dancer club.
No it was like... There was some uh... You know, I was in Europe in some of 'em.
Um... You might wanna um... Check somewhere else cause we really don't really do that.
There's this one where I'm in a canoe. It's pretty neat.
Well, we really don't do that kinda stuff here. So you might wanna check somewhere else.
Actually, Leather said I could bring 'em down.
Who?
Leatha.
Umm... I don't think so, but you might wanna check somewhere else--
What... like... what... like... what... You keep saying that. Why don't you give me... Why don't you just offer a solution instead of just... You know... A status quo mentality.
Ummm... Well, because I really don't know of any other... uhh... uh... places--
What... I mean...
--that offer female dancers... uh... Because we--
What your saying is like a... is a... totally Darwinian uh... way of going about things.
I'm sorry. Say that again?
What you're proposing is a complete Darwinian society.
A Darwinian society? Do you know what Darwin proposed?
Do I know? No. No, I don't know.
Well then don't propose the Darwinian society. Because you have no idea what Darwin proposed. So don't even try to pull that bullshit up on me.

I don't accept your rhetoric. How does that sound?
Um wha... I'm sorry. Say that again?

Uhh... What rhetoric?
Or jargon or whatever it is.
What jargon? I'm sorry, I think you're drunk, sir. And I think you need to go. Bye bye.

Uhh, girl.
[Stuttering vocal noise]
[Pause]
They call me the-- the Polish Stallion.
Look, I refuse to get into an insulting phone call. Because you see, then all kinds of nasty legal things can ensue. But you know, that comment was just recorded, and you know what that could do? That can be considered sexual harassment, my dear sir.
Which one?
I don't need to repeat your uh... I gues you could say 'slanderous' umm... ethnic remarks.
I'm just looking for an analogue wig here. I dunno...
Well, we don't have them.
What?
Analogue wigs.
Uh-huh.
You might try our sister store at Tech America if such device does exist. But we do not have them here. I do recognize your voice and we do-- This is a place of business. We do not need you tying up our phone lines with harassing phone calls.
Oh, girl. I bet you got a device, don't ya? Goin' down?

My name is Robert Lewis, and I'm calling today because your Capital One credit card company...
Right.
...would like to show their appreciation to you as a valued member, and send you a three month review period of up to $1,000,000 of accidental insurance at no cost to you, and sir, this is just our way of saying thank you, and to introduce you to the coverage...
What, I'm in danger?
No, this is just accidental death insurance, sir.
Sounds good.
And...also, just before the three month period is over, they will send you a reminder asking you if you would like to continue with it or not, and if you choose to continue with it, the premium is only $7.95 a month, this will never increase at any time...
With a $1,000,000 one-time charge?
Huh? Huh, sir? Hello?
Is that what you're saying?
Uh...the one million dollars?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's...one...
It's $1,000,000 per accident...
A month, or...?
Yeah, a month. $7.95 a month.
Okay.
And this will never increase. And if you choose not to continue with it, there is a 1-800 number that you can call at any time to cancel...
Kay...
...and you will owe nothing for the plan.
Kay. 'Kay, 'kay.
And your middle initial is V, sir?
Yep.
Oh, hold on...

Hmm?
Uh...so, unless I die, it's not...
You don't really have to die just to get it, sir.

What...
...like, if you lose eyesight or something, or if you lose a limb.
Wait, are you telling me I'm in some kind of danger here, partner?
No, sir. It's just accidental death insurance. It's something you can review in your own home while being covered for it also, for three full months.
I'll tell you who's gonna be dismembered.
Who?
But I don't think you're gonna like it.
Okay, sir...
No, I don't...I don't wish to get the coverage.
Okay...
But if I'm dismembered, I'll give you a holler.
Okay, thanks...

Hello, Orange Julius Southwest.

[In the voice of a little girl]
Do you have leprechaun julius?
Yes. We have urine juliuses. They're delicious. FUCK OFF YOU LITTLE SHIT.
(Laughing)
Leprechaun julius.
Excuse me...
New England Chowder House, Jake speaking. Can I help you?
Yeah, I was interested in a batfish.
In a batfish? Let's... I doubt we got any. Hold on.
[In the background] Do we got batfish?
Nope. We have no batfish.
Hmm... Do you have any snakefish?
Nope.
Would you check on it?
[In the background] Hey, I think it's a punk caller, but do we have any snakefish?
We have salmon, mahi, catfich, and seabass. That's about all we got today. No Snakefish. We looked in the dictionary. Couldn't find it.
How about, um, sea spider?
Uhhh, that don't exist either.
Would you go ahead and double check it?
Yeah... hold on one sec.
Incomprehensible chatter in the background
Sorry, yeah. We don't have any. We don't even serve it. All we have is what I told you.
Is there fish lip?
Ummm. You could order a fish and cut the lip off if you want to.
Alright.
Huh. Do you have seahorses?
[Laughter]
Phone Hangup
We go next to Wallace. Hello Wallace, you're on 760.
Howdy.
Howdy.
You were trying to find out...ways Latrell Sprewell could take out his boss.
Or anybody could take out the boss. Maybe you want to take out your boss, hope not.
I, I'd take, ah...a tennis racket...to his lip.
Well, so...you're saying Leo "the Lip" Durocher, that'll get him in.
Or, I'd put a spider...on their...head.
I think you're in, in...good shape, sir. [laughs]
Anyway, what was the deal with Bernie Bickerstaff, taunting Haven Moses about...something, getting hit with a frisbee... Macaulay Culkin, or something like that?
I missed that one. Joe, you know..
Nope. I don't know what you're talking about.
It was on ESPN.
Yeah, I didn't see ESPN last night.
Haven Moses? Are you talking about Tom Jackson?
Yes.
Okay. I missed it.
Yeah.
Irv, I wanted to tell you, great job on the Jake Jabs piece. That was something special, I think.
Jake Jabs is something else, boy...
I'll tell you what, he can play...he can play the banjo pretty dang well, too.
I'll tell you what, he's an auctioneer, I've heard him.
[distorted]
about, ah...Jake Jabs...talk about Dick Trickle for a little bit. Do a little bit of that?
[laughing in background]
[sighs] Thank you, Eric.
Was that Eric?
I guess. [laughs]
Wallace, are you still there?
I guess Wallace is gone.
804-5855. Eric, we...
Bit of a funny hour, this hour.
It is. We...
(Guitar playing in background for first 15 seconds of track)
(Waffle House) Well, who, who else is on the line?
(Wall Units) Unintelligible
(Waffle House) Okay, so did you call here?
(Wall Units) No.
(Waffle House) Oh.
(Wall Units) It doesn't make any sense.
(Waffle House) No it don't. Well I'll hang up and let the other party call me back.
(Wall Units) Well I don't have him on now.
(LPC) Who, who's on line line now, here?
(Waffle House) Okay.
(LPC) Who am I speaking with?
(Waffle House) Well, I'm Gwen at the Waffle House.
(LPC) I don't even know who I'm talking to.
(Waffle House) Well, I'm Gwen. Somebody called the Waffle House.
(LPC) Now who's this gentleman?
(Waffle House) I don't know.
(Wall Units) I'm with Wall Units.
(Waffle House) Well wait a minute. Let me put it this way, which one of you all called the Waffle House? (pause) Since everybody seems to be lost, let's just hang up and see where...
(Wall Units) Let's all hang up.
(Waffle House) Alright, bye.
(LPC) But see, I think, I think you guys are on the right, the right track there. Hello? Wall Units, hello?
(To the tune of The Beautiful People)
The beautiful pigeon / the beautiful pigeon / the beautiful pigeon / the beautiful pigeon. (beep).
Yeah, this is Dr. Slap. And I'm about to send shockwaves with some electric slap bass. At the Bass Get Down Junction, 1999.
(Strange noises to end of track)
(ring)
Who's this?
Hi, this is Ben.
Ben?
Ah, from Collective Soul.
Oh, hi, how are you?
Fine. Sorry, I was returning a page.
Oh, I didn't page you. My name's Brian McPherson.
Brian McPherson?
Yeah.
Oh, you, uh, you're the attorney, right?
I am an attorney, yes.
Oh, I say 'the' attorney because I don't, I don't know any. But I know about you, so...
Oh...how do you know about me?
(clears throat) Uh, I, I was, uh talking to, uh, somebody from that band Negativland, actually.
(Laughs) Oh, I'm sure they have lots of nice things to say about me, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was all good. So, but, that's doesn't explain the page I got, though.
No, it doesn't. You know, that's funny, I heard from those Negativland guys, and I didn't even say anything to them. It's like, they just felt compelled to send me an email, because I represent Beck, and because I said copyright infringement is wrong, you know?
Oh.
And I was like 'Hey, who asked ya?', you know? It's like, mind your own business.
Well, I'm sure then, you wouldn't, uh, want to be part of their camp.
Oh, I don't give a shit what they do. And, it's like, you know, fine. But you know, if I represent somebody whose work is being ripped off, and, and they're mad about it, the client, then I'll do whatever the client asks me to. But in this case, Beck said 'I don't care'. So, I'm like, okay, I don't care either.
Okay, yeah, so as far as Collective Soul is concerned, uh, and you know, while I've got you on the phone, um...I mean, do you know what our problem is? Can you...?
No, what, what do you guys have going on?
Nothing. We just don't seem that good, you know.
(Laughs) Who is this, man?
Ben.
Ben from Collective Soul? Ben what?
Claypaper.
Ben Claypaper. Who is this?
INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPTION: 1:45 - 5:10 (end of track) has not yet been transcribed.
(Scott Baio) Hello?
(LPC) Hey, how's it going?
Alright...
Ummm. So, do you want to shoot a little hoop, or?
(Baio says something unintelligible)
Oh, I see. Don't think you can cut it, huh?
Probably not.
Well they call me Virtual Balboa, out there on the court, so...What are you up to about now?
Uhhhhhh, working.
Kay.
You?
Just dribbling. Dribbling all over.
God bless you (maybe?)
You wanna get something going?
Who is this?

(Unintelligible)
Let's get something cooking.
Let me call you back.
Alright.
(hang up)
(ring)
(Scott Baio) Hello?
(LPC) Hey, what's going on? Just wanted to see if you wanted to get something together?
Yeah, tell me where.
(sigh) Well, I, I wonder if you could get somewhere I could pick you up in my 'copter.
(Laughs) This is funny.
You in or out, man? That's all I'm trying to get to.
No, I'm out.
Awwww! It's not 'till like five A.M. tomorrow.
Oh, well that's, I'll be, I'll be sleeping.
Ohhhh. Well, want to do a little dribbling, or what?
No, I gave that up.
Well, okay, you got that hundred bucks you owe me, man?
I sent it in the mail.
Pssh, I didn't get it.
Oh, well I'll send it again.
(Chuckles) You don't have to do that, but I mean...shouldn't have to cost you two-hundred. Where'd you send it?
It was only a hundred.
I know, but if you send it again, that's be two-hundred, right?
I can afford it.
Alright.
Same address?
Actually, I moved.
Okay, what's that address?
Nintey-four-thousand-three hundred and eighty...
Dollars?
Mojave Loop.
I've heard of that place.
Santa Cruz. Hello?
(Hang up sound)
(End of track)
(Ring)
Hello?

(End of track)
(feedback)
(LPC)
How's it going? (Feedback) Yeah, my chassis has a gleek in it.
Your chassis has a leak in it?
Gleek.
Ok.
(Feedback)
How's that sound?
(Feedback)
Uh, what's the...still getting a little whine there.
Huh?
Your chassis has a leak in it?
Gleek.
A Gleek?
In my rotor.
(laughs) Interesting.
(Feedback)
So, I want to use a coupon.
Oh, man, we're closed right now, so you want to...
My manifold has a smack in it.
Has a smack? That's cool. What caused the smack?
(feedback)
The gleek.
Like some drug money or something? Or what's going on?
(Feedback increases and remains present for remainder of call)
What's the, ah, status on that Tempo?
Tempo? There's no Tempo here.
Oh, it's done?
There's no Tempo here.
What time'd it get finished?
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.
I thought they was gonna give me a phone call or something.
Whatever, man.
Hey man, why don't you come down and talk to me in person sometime like that.
What? Who the hell is this? What are you talking about dude?
Why don't you come down sometime brother? I'll, I'll rearrange your manifold personally, cuz.
(Laughs) That's pretty funny.
Why dont you shut your trap, young man.
Man, shut the fuck up dude.
How's it going?
Alright, fuckin' stoned.
(Feedback starts) You're stoned, what's up, man? What kinda music you play man?
Oh, I don't know if you could describe it, 'cause I don't really have a guitar player that I play with all the time.
Is it bad or what?
I like it a fuckin' lot. You know, it just depends on what you're into, you know?
Is it fucked up, or?
No, it's just like...It's like, I don't know...a cross between Ministry and fuckin' Helmet or somethin'.
Helmet, yeah. (Feedback) Bad.
...More like the Godflesh thing.
Godflesh.
(Unintelligible)
So are you a good drummer? Did I ask you that already?
Oh, I play bass.
You're the bassist, so you're probably not a good...
I have a dude who plays drums with me.
Oh.
He's fucking awesome, I like the way he plays. And we click together.
Is it fucked up, or?
It's fuckin' sick, I think. I'm not really...a good bass player. But, hey, I get into it, you know what I mean?
Oh yeah.
I've only been playing, probably, two years.
You make some rumble, huh? You're responsible for some low end?
Fuckin' noise...
Right on.
...to get people's hearts fuckin'...Do you have a place to practice?
I sure do.
Well, it's something, I think it's something we could dig. Maybe we could come down and jam, see what it sounds like. We'll check it out. Right now my bass is down, I'm getting it repainted.
Yeah, what do you play again?
A
B.C. Rich Ironbird
Woah.
It's fuckin', I think it's fuckin' bad.
Is it intense?
It's the fuckin' baddest shape I've ever seen.
Woah. What color are you gettin', getting it painted?
I want to get it black with this fucking like webbing across it.
What?
It's like a webbing, but it's not
symmetrical
though, it's just like...
Oh, a web.
Yeah.
Like white web? Or some...
Well, actually it's like fucking blue, getting it over black and then like a red pearl over it.
Intense.
It'll look all sick, it'll be...
Is it fretless, bro?
No, it's not.
That's cool. Right on, thank you Chuck.
Thanks alot dude.
Bye.
Take it easy.
NOTE: It sounds like LPC is not the person who makes this call. I believe this call is made by Mark Hosler of Negativland.
INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPTION: 0:00 - 4:35 of this call has not yet been transcribed.
...Now, ummm, I have your mailing address there, can I mail you some literature, and some other things, and perhaps you could join one of our prayer meetings?
Uh, fine.
Okay, can I send tracts and literature to, to yo...Can I pass them out at the bank? Could I come down...
No, we're not allowed to...
...It's a Christian bank?
But you still can't pass out literature. We only pass out literature if it pertains right to the bank.
Okay.
We can't pass out any other literature.
Are there any crucifix or anything hanging up in the bank?
No.
Can I bring them, nail it up?
No.
Could I, just in the enterance of the door?
No.
I'll just, I, I...You know it will be clear, I'll do a lucite cross, it's no problem.
No.
Wouldn't you feel better walking in every morning if you had that hanging?
Well, the thing is, that's not permitted in the bank.
Well, how about a lamb? How about just a lamb? I mean, as a, I could give you some more lamb questions, but how about if I just bring something that represents the...
...We aren't allowed to have anything hanging...
A thorny crown. You could pin it up to the wall.
Okay, none of that is permitted.
Let me read a couple more references.
Okay, I have to wait on a customer. She's been sitting here.
Is she, what? What, a loan? If she doesn't have Jesus on her side, she won't get a penny.
I'm sorry, but I have to...
Ask her if she's got Jesus on her...
I'm sorry I can't ask questions like that.
Ask her, I'll give her lamb questions, what do you need?
I can not ask questions of a customer at my desk like that kind of question.
Ask her...how do you know? Maybe she wants to hear it.
I'm sorry but we're not allowed to.
Her life might be at such a point...
I'm sorry, but I can't do this kind of things with the customer. Sorry, I have to go now.
Dear Lord...Let me just say a prayer, I'll say one prayer and I'll let you go, okay? Hello!?!
Hello.
Yeah, just five secs, okay?
Uh huh.
I have only the best intentions for you. I want you to go to heaven. I want your family to be blessed by Jesus and God...
Okay, no, I have to go to my customer.
D, don't miss out on the blessing. This whole call will not be for naught.
I'm sorry.
Please, just five seconds. Don't...Please don't go to hell (unintelligible). The devil's the devil's just looking down right now. Just let me say. Oh, dear lord, please help this young woman, allow to see her to go to heaven and have evertything washed and cleansed of her sins. That's all I needed to say to you.
Okay.
How do you feel now?
I have to go to my customer.
Well, just tell me how you feel. I want to make sure I helped.
I have this customer that has to be waited on.
Okay, Ju, I tell you what. God bless you. You are terriffic, and you're professional. And the lord knows that, and your customers will appreciate that, and they'll see that you give excellent service. God bless you.
Thank you.
Good, good day.
(hangup sound)
(End of track)
...Oh future call sale. Those races, get out there and run a marathon, you haven’t done that for awhile, will ya? (laughs) 804-8055 is our phone number. And we go next to Tob, Toby, on 760. Hello Toby.
Howdy.
Howdy.
I wanted to talk a little bit about Evonne Goolagong this afternoon.
About who?
Evonne Goolagong. Now, uh, she knew how to smack the tennis ball.
You want to talk about Evonne Goolagong?
Uh-huh.
Is that...Am I hearing you correctly? You want to talk about Evonne Goolagong?
Yes sir.
(Laughs) Alright, go ahead. What about her?
She’ll smack the tennis ball. Uhhhh…
Yeah. (Unintelligible)
Do you know anything about the, uh, rematch over on Smoky Hill Road, there with uh, Goolagong and Gugliotta, scheduled to take place?
WHAT?!? Red dog (explosion sound effects) We’re not following you. I’m not sure, uh that was a little different. One thing, hey, I either had too long of a weekend (you did) OR, this man has started early. That guy, that call is about as much fun as pink eye. In either case we’ve got to, uh, pick it up a little bit. (That’s right). Let’s go to Jeff, we’re looking for those free agents (In background laughs and “Goolagong”). (More laughter). That’s good.

If he's talking about a ...a COD, it doesn't belong to us.
Well, I think...
And he wasn't rude to your son, cause I was lying on the couch listening to him. He just said, "Bring it on by." He was...something that's not coming to us.
I think you need to re-evaluate where you're coming from.
I think that I will call the police if you continue to harrass me, because I don't understand why you're bothering me.
[audio begins, plays throught this call]
It's a COD, eight-hundred and fourty-two dollars.
T
hen I don't have a COD coming to me, sir. Nothing. Your son owes me twenty-five dollars. So I don't know...
It's a of ninety-six hundred gallon tank of squid from...
We did not order any nine-hundred and...thank you.
Yeah?
Yeah, this is Bernard over at United Parcel. What, uh, what seems to be the trouble here?
United Parcel?
Yeah.
Yeah? Fuck you--drop dead.
I think that you need to re-evalute your guys' position.
I think you need to come over here so I can kick your ass.
This is a nine hundred and twenty dollar COD delivery.
Good. You bring it on over here.
Oh, we'll be there in ten to fifteen minutes
That's a good idea, you bring it on over here and I'll have the cops here to meet you.
We need certified funds today.
You bring it.

No, I did not order it and I'm gonna have...if you don't give me a number or your last name, or who you work for, I'm calling the police and having them file a report file. I went through this before with you people. I'm not playing this a second time.

We'll be there in fifteen minutes.
Fine, I'll have the police here waiting for you.
We'll have a four hundred and sixteen pound squid that's in a tank...

Hello?

I'm Dawson Yassen, and I'm trying to gather some information about the election.
You know, you called here twice in the last minute, fella, and you'd better stop.

Well, I'll give you $450.
Yeah, I bet you will. I'm sure you will. I'm sure you will. And, let me tell you one other thing, you call back here, and you'll be paying somebody else $450, like a lawyer.
You should vote for me.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Have a nice evening
You should vote...
Do not call back.
I need you to tell me who you voted for, or if you even voted.
Excuse me?
Who'd you vote for, pal?
Who'd I vote for, "pal"? I voted for Mao Zedong.
Who?
Mao Zedong. [

I'ma
whoop ya in the ass.
laughing
] Go back to your stew!
Yes,
who-
I was just wondering who you voted for?
Uh, I think I asked you not to call here. I think I asked you not to call here twice. And I'm not, and I won't ask again.
I was calling to find out who you were going to vote for?
That is none of your business. Don't call again, you called us eight times, we're sick of it.
No, I didn't even call you before.
Oh, yes you have. Don't call again.
Yes, I was just calling to ask who you voted for?
Who are
you
voting for?
Well...that's not the nature of the call.
Well, what the hell is the nature of the call? It's none of your business!
I'll give you $450
for the information
Bullshit. You tell me who I should vote for, I'm going for the opposite.
Who should I vote for?
Have I got your solemn word
You ain't got nothin'.
Well, I need to know who you plan on voting for.
Well, that's too damn bad!
Who are you voting for?
Why do you want to know?
I need to know.
Who? Why?
I give you money.
I- you don't give me '

Who are you voting for?
It's none of your business.
Who is this?

Hello?
Yes, sir. I'm Fagan.
I don't give a shit who you are, it's none of your business who I voted for!
Hi, I'm Ollie, and I
was
calling to ask who you voted for.
Nobody.
Can I ask why please, ma'am?
Because I don't give a shit.
Hi, I'm Ollie calling, and…
I don't care.
I'm calling to ask who you're voting for…
I do not care.
I'm in the Neighborhood Coalition
You're just a fucking...annoying dude.
Hello?
Hello?
This is Dick calling, and I was just calling to ask who you were voting for
Oh, that's private. And you just called this number, I think. Do you have a phone number?
Yeah.
Could you tell it to me?
Well, I'm just-I'm the one calling you...
No, I'm asking you. If you want to ask me a personal question, I think I should be able to ask you one, and I think that thing you just said was obnoxious, but since I've got caller ID, alright; I might not need you to answer the question for me. I think that was kind of an obnoxious response.
What
What you just said.
Which was what
And I don't think you need to be calling this number, and if you call this number again...
Yeah
...I'm gonna press charges against you, do you understand?
Well, I'll give you $450 for the information
You'll PAY me, to tell you who I will vote for? That's illegal.
No
Yeah.
[callback]
Hello?
Hi, this is Dick calling.
Why are you calling here? Do you need a doctor?
I just want to know who you're...
No, I'm asking you, are you seeing a psychiatrist, because you really need to be calling them and not me.
What is your...deal here, tonight?
Sir, you've called me three times and I've asked you not to call, what is your deal?
Well, I've asked you not
Do you not respect an individual? Do you know my name?
Do you know my name
You need to talk to your doctor! Do you understand me?
About what
You're not supposed to be calling three times in a row, if they don't want to talk to you, they don't want to talk to you. Why do you keep calling them?
I want to know who you're voting for
That's harassment. [
nervous laughs
] That's none of your business!
You're harassing me, pal
Excuse me, sir? You need to talk to your doctor.
I think that tone is harassment
Sir, if you call here again, I'm gonna press charges against you. There is something very seriously wrong with you, and you need to see your doctor.
And I got too much at stake riding on this
You do? Are you an alcoholic too, sir?
A person's vote is their private business. You have called this number, this is your third time. You've been asked not to call, and I don't understand what your mind is thinking, and I have no idea and I really don't care.
I'm going to pay you to tell me who you're voting for
You're not going to pay me, no.
It's that simple
Sir...
I'll pay you a visit and

Tomorrow's Brides, this is Megan. How can I help you?
Hello.
What are you having done? Is it a haircut?
Hair and message, I'm thinkin'.
Do you wanna do an hour message? Half-hour?
I'd like to take two or three hours just to get things goin' a little bit. And then spend the rest of the day just gettin' into a
real
hypnotic message. You guys got any ointment there? Skin ointment?
Skin ointment?
Yeah
For sale?
For use.
Well, in the message, they use message oils.
Uh, for real personal use. Some techniques I picked up on the Nile River.
Umm, sir, please stop calling! I don't know what kind of salon you think this is, but it's not the type you want.
Gel me up, down...
Sir! We don't have appointments for you! Please stop calling! If you keep calling, I'm gonna have to call the cops.
-some of your guys to bring a boat by, so I can get on the water and test drive it.
You need some of our guys to bring a boat by. Bring a boat by where, sir?
I live on the water, it's not going to be a logistical problem.
I'm sorry, sir.
Oh, you are?
Excuse me?
Well...
I just picked up the phone and said hello, sir. Maybe you'd like to fill me in on something?
Okay, let me fill you on something right on the tip of my tongue here, and that's that I'm Bernard Fuddle, and I've been on the water for 47 years. I've been on schooners. I've been on an eighty foot yacht. Many times.
In Colorado?
Now I live in La Junta, and I need a couple boats up. I've got hundreds of millions of dollars, but what you don't seem to fathom is that I need to get on the water
a-LONE
for two to three days to make a decision. How does that sound right off the bat?
It sounds like right off the bat that there might be a couple of things that you and YOUR money don't fathom. I'm a little surprised that you would call, and be surprised that I didn't know who you were; and that...over the phone I would tell you that why sure, we'll send however many boats you want for how many days you want...
Phone? Hell, I'm here now. I'm ready to meet up with your representative.
Well, where's "here" now?
I'm in La Junta, Colorado.
Um...OK.
Hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
Uh-huh. You know...I would like to help you sir, but you're not making it very easy on my end.
Oh, no?
Well...
I'm ready to come down there...
...and I have some statements that you're very wealthy, and it seems to me your time is worth more than mine, and I'm trying to work through this with you, but..uh..you know, I'm listening...
I saw the hot air bal-
What is the name of the business you called?
I saw the blimp in the air.
The blimp?
And I called the number.
I don't have any blimp flying in the air.
I think you're barking up the wrong tree with YOUR attitude here, pal. I've been on the water 44 years, and I expect...I've been on the
sea
for half that many years.
You know, is it your money that buys you the respect?
The boot on my
foot
...which I'll take to your
seat
You know, I'm really impressed with that...could you, um...goodness gracious, a phone call like this and you're telling me all those things, you're gonna put a boot in my ass, and I'm still on the telephone with you! I'm wondering if you dialed the business you think you have. Which kind of boat is it you're looking for?
Are you false advertising with your blimps, or where...I don't know where you stand...
Sir, we don't have any blimps in the air. Maybe you're trying to call Goodyear.
I think that you need to examine where you stand, before you put stuff in the air!
Well, sir, I'm standing right behind the counter. Now where did you call?
I called the number in the air, and if you guys are putting stuff out in the air and you can't even put your HANDS on it...heh, boy...
This company doesn't have any blimps in the air.
You're gonna have a lip on the sidewalk, if you make me come down there. I've got
hundreds
of millions of dollars at my disposal. And...
Could I ask the number you dialed?
I need two boats, this weekend. Have you ever been to La Junta, Colorado before? Well, that's where I keep hundreds of MILLIONS of dollars.
You know what, it seems like you've had a couple of drinks, I'm not for sure. But I'm going to ask you one more time: the phone number that you've called...
I'm not going to ask you, again! When can you be here? I'm in La Junta, I'm on the water. I'm on the water now, ready to do business. I'm ready to do a transaction that you put figures in the air...
Sir...
And I'll
whip y'ass
Okay. Why don't you stick that boot through the phone line and get to kicking?
Hello?
Yeah... This is... uhh... Fennel Cartwright. I'm Fennel Cartwright.
For what?
And I gotta bring you your shipment here today.
What's my shipment?
And I just wanted to know the best time to do so, so...
What do you mean, 'my shipment'? What's that?
It's uhh... C.O.D. We need eight-hundred and forty-eight dollars.
What's a C.O.D.?
On the C.O.D. Your package. I have the signiature on the package.
I didn't order anything.
You got rocks and pebbles in your yard?
No.
Why don't you go get it straightened up now. Rake it or whatever you need.
No. But I didn't order anything. Why you need to send me anything. I...
I need a check today!
What's the address? Whoever order what...
I'm comin' down.
Forget about it. I didn't order it.
You forget it, pal.
Yeah, yeah. But wha- wha- what- wha- what- what's the address?
Ahhhh, I'm in ah... I'm in Wheat Ridge.
(Talking over the person on the other line)'
Yeeeeeeah. Yeeeeah. I got the squid for you.
(Continuing to talk over the person on the other line)
Yeeeah, I'm comin' down. Yeah, I'm going to make it there in fifteen, twenty. I got a big old squid. Big old tank. I'll come, put it in the yard.
(Continuing to talk over the person on the other line)
Go ahead and clean up your yard so I can... I need a check. Eight hundred and forty-eight dollars. You're gonna write me a check. And I'm gonna pick it up, and I'm gonna put the squid on yooouuu.
That's all? Wh- wh- what's that mean?
You wanna meet out in the yard, and I'll push ya around?
(Heavy breathing into the phone)
What's your phone number?
What's your phone number?
What the hell's my name?
What's your name and phone number?
What's my name?
Yeah, what's your name?
What's my phone number?
What's your number?
Where's your uhhh... check book at?
(Heavy breathing into the phone)
You've reached Bobby. Hello?
Yeah, this is Brown from Liberty Squid calling.
Yeah.
And uh, I'm calling about your shipment we got on the dock here - the tank, 43 squids.
I think you've got the wrong place, pal.
Nope.
What's, what are you, what's the name of the business?
I don't know, it's... on the tank and there's 43 squid - forty-two hundred and eighteen dollars even on the COD.
This is a little bar, neighborhood bar. Now you got the wrong place, you understand me?
I don't think you seem to understand the... what's going on
here
. I've worked for UPS for fourteen years.
I don't give a damn if you've worked for 'em for forty four years. It's not my stuff, I have nothing to do with it so don't bother me.
I'm going to send Oliver, our best driver, down and he's going to personally talk to you about this.
Well, I hope he's big him down on his ass. You come with 'im.
This is a tank full of squid, pal, and you guys are -
I don't care whether it's a tank full of pussy. I don't want none of if. Don't bother me. I'm busy.

Umm, I think you have the wrong number.

Uh, apparently, y'all ordered some Chinese bolwing balls, but there was no freight payed on it.
Oh that's too bad.
Is it?
Yeah.
Ok, well.
Hey, wait a minute. Let me talk for a minute. We've never ordered anything from China. The last thing would be bowling balls. So you know what you can do with those bowling balls?
No.
Well, I won't tell you over the telephone.
How 'bout I come down there and tell you what
you
can do with 'em?
You can bring those blrk...belding balls [sic]...bowling balls down here and I'll have the police ready for you when you get here.
Sir, your balance is three hundred and eighty two dollars and...
I don't give a shit what it is--we didn't order them! Do with them what you will!
Hello?
Yeah, my name is Walter, I'm an administrator up here at UPS. What appears to be the problem here tonight, sir?
You have to be kidding. Now look, use your good common sense. We're standing here playing pool and you think we orderd seven bowling balls from China? I told the other guy what he could do with the bowling balls.
And what was that?

Like I said, we're a salsa and merengue place, a Latin...we have a lot of Latin music here, so.
Oh, you do?
Yeah, that's all we play here. I've already tried all the other different... I've tried blues nights. I've tried jazz and nothing else works other than the Latin music so that's what I [step to].
Would you try, uh, moistenin' me up? Or...
I would not be inclined to try it.
Well, I mean, they gave me your number, you know.
Who gave you my number?
Um, Kokey Blaylock.
Kokey Blaylock? Kokey Blaylock...I don't know who Kokey Blaylock is.
Ohhhh. At least you gotta pay me back then.
I gotta pay you back?
Yes.
Pay you back for what?
Like with PayPal or somethin'.
With PayPal?
Yeah...you can just go online and just, uh, send me a payment.
A payment of what?
Well, it'd be like a hundred and seventy-five.
A hundred seventy-five dollars, for...?
Plus, plus their seven percent fee. So it'd actually be like uh, one eighty-two total.
What would I be paying you for?
Well, I mean, the referal. If you're not gonna get, get me moisturization, then, like, I just need reimbursement, you know, just expenses.
Expenses? I didn't hire you, I didn't call you, I didn't...you know.
Oh yes, you did. For the whole beautification project.
What beautification project are you talking about?
Mookey Blaylock.
I don't know who Mookey Blaylock is, I don't know what they hell you're talking about.
Well all of a sudden you expect me to be a merengue dancer or somethin' and all I'm sayin'...
What are you talking about? You called me, all right? You called me and you're telling me that...
No, I didn't.
...beautification. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a bar owner, I'm a bar owner and I have... that's the kinds of bands...
How do you expect me to dance? Seriously!
What dancing? What dancing? What the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about a few good old boys. Coming down. Gettin' moisturized. And then you're talking about merengue dancing and I've already outlaid a hundred seventy-five dollars through Kokey Blaylock.
That's not my fault. That's not my fault. You need to talk to Quarky, or whoever the hell gave you my number, cause that's not my fault. I had nothing to do with that.
It was on a wall.
"It was on a wall." Dude, lose my number, all right?
Yes it is.
Lose my number.
Hello, this is George.
George, yeah, listen. Can I just get an online payment from you?
You're not getting no payments from me. I don't know who you are, you just gonna pick up the phone and call me and tell me "send me a payment"? You're crazy!
We'll call it good. One seventy-five, you can just skip...
You're full of it buddy. Lose my number!
You can just skip the fees, you know?
What fees are you talking about!
The PayPal!
I don't know who you are, I've never hired you, I have nothing to do with you...
You've never heard of Mookie Blaylock before. Is that what...
I don't know who the hell Mookie Blaylock is!
You secured it with Kokey Blaylock for me to come out here.
I didn't secure with anybody, anything.
And now you're not going to moisturize us?
Moisturize...what the hell are you talking about? What are you talking about "moisturizing"? What moisturizing? What the hell are you talking about?
I'm lookin' at a digital signature from you.
Uh huh. From me.
And you can skip the song and dance about the merengue stuff. All I need is a PayPal.
You "need a PayPal." Cause I hired you, cause I didn't hire anybody. I didn't hire you, I don't know who Mookey is, I don't know what you're talking about. You're calling the wrong person.
Let me give you my email address.
I don't want your email address.
And you can send me a PayPal payment.
I'm not going to send you no PayPal payment!
We'll call it good.
Talk to my lawyer. I don't know who the hell you are. You're just gonna pick up the phone and call me and say, "Oh yeah, send me a hundred and seventy-five dollars." You're full of shit!
Absolutely not.
What are you talking about? I don't know who you are. I never hired you. I don't know who this Mookie-person you're talking about is. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You can skip the seven percent.
You're calling me telling me I don't know what the hell moisurizing is? The fuck you talking about, dude?
Beautification of the whole project, man.
Of what project!? I don't know what freakin' project you're talking about.
I'm thinking just some good old boys coming down.
Thinking of some good old boys coming down and I'm gonna pay a hundred seventy-five bucks for some good old boys coming down to do what?
We can't do merengue movements and things like that. It's not gonna happen.
I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know what you're talking about. Lose my number or you're going to piss me off. You're going to fuckin' piss me off. Lose my fucking number. You call me one more time, I swear, dude... Let me run across you, you son of a bitch. Lose my number.
Why don't you just send me a PayPal payment and we'll call it good?
We're not calling anything here nothing.
You want a seventy-five, why don't you come over here and come collect...
It's one seventy-five.
Come over here and try to collect the money. Come over here. And try to collect that money.
Well if it's certified, I will.
Certified what? There's not certification -I don't know who you are.
I'm not takin' personal checks.
I'm not giving you no money. Ok? I'm not giving you no money.
I already incurred a hundred seventy-five dollars in expenses.
Well that's not my fault! I don't know who they hell you are!
If you don't have moisture and you've got all kinds of other thins happening, that's not my fault.
What the hell's moisture? What the hell are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

You can just go to hell, ok? Cause I don't know who you are, why you're bothering me.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm calling about these dogs over there.
My dogs are doing nothing. I don't know what the problem is. They haven't done anything. I don't know where you live or who you are, so I wish you would quit bothering me before I have to call the police and tell them that there's someone harassing me!
Your dogs harass me!
My dogs are doing nothing.
What are their names?
None of Your Business is what their names are!
That won't do.
That's fine! I don't care. It's none of your business what the names of my animals are. They have done nothing wrong.
In the terms of the law, they have.
Oh, excuse me. Would you like to tell me what they've done in the terms of the law?
Gnashing, for one.
What is mashing?
I saw a prairie dog getting gnashed by animals recently.
My dogs have not hurt animals. We don't have any prairie dogs. My dogs do not hurt other animals. I've done nothing wrong and my animals have done nothing wrong. They were on private property in my yard. So I don't know who you are or why you're bothering me, but STOP CALLING THIS NUMBER.

This community will not tolerate it.
It's quiet.

If you have a problem then you need to call the police.
I might just do that.
Just go right ahead and do it.

[laughs] Not bad...you know, you're right about the head bob, though. I could never, I don't...I could never cure myself of the head bob at the end of the story.
It's cool.
You can-
Scott Cortelyou helped me out with this.
[laughs] I'll get him for that!
Do I-,do I...I know you, don't I-...?
[hangs up]
Well...we'll never know now, Grover...
["Grover" loops and deteriorates]
My concern was Grover, that was my concern. But if Grover is a part of other peoples' little schemes, Grover goes along with little schemes,
then
that's what hurts more than anything. Because when I met Grover, I met a decent person. That's the way I look at it. I can't look at it any other way. But I'm just saying to you, you know, Grover; you know, you're young. And, ah..you know, I'm real puzzled about this whole situation, you know, because here I was building you up and everything, and then, ah...y'know, I'm kind of stunned, you know?.
Oh...
So...what is going on? But my biggest concern now is the rumors I've been hearing. And if I don't like what I heard, you know...then you'd be more of a
hinder
to us, more than a
help
to us. And...people ask and then they start challenging it, and then Channel 9 News involved...and...4 News is involved, you know; and 7 News is involved...
Yeah.
And I hate to see you get into any kind of a situation like that...you're never going to please anybody, you know? So I have to believe as of right now, you don't know.
I don't know..I don't even...I'm not even sure what we're talking about, at this point.
Well, I know what I'm sure...I, I know what I'm sure of, what I'm talking about, and that's why I'm not talking to
you
about it, because I already know what I'm talking about.
That's
what I'm saying. I really felt like..an
idiot
Hello?
Yeah, it's Sandyman.
Hello--who's this?
I'm from the band. Sandyman.
From the band?
Yeah.
How ya doin'? How can I help you?

Do we wanna get slapped?
Yeah.
Naw, I don't wanna get slapped.
You ever heard of Sandyman, the band?
Sandyman? Can't say I have.
Tell ya what? Why don't you take my platinum card number and just get things runnin' a little bit for me.
Uh, yeah, well, we need to have the card present.

Oh, why don't you tell me directions to get there, then?
Nah, you know what, buddy? Lose my number. Lose my number. Stop calling me.
Hello?
Howdy, it's Sandy.
I'm busy, dude. Ok?
What's shakin'?

You wanna do a little butt slappin' tonight? Or...
Listen to me, listen to me. Ok, this is very important that you pay attention. I'm not fucking with you and I don't have the patience for this shit. Ok? You need to cut this bullshit out.
You're the one playin' games, my friend.
You're the one playin' games, buddy. You're the one callin' me. Lose my fucking number.
You wanna meet up with my vice grips or what?
You know what? I have six cops sitting at my fucking bar, dude. Would you like to talk to one of them?
No!
All right, then shut the fuck up and stop calling me. I'm losing my fucking patience with you.
I got a vice grips I'm gonna bring in there...
Do you understand that I was a DEA agent? And I worked for the feds? So you're calling the

You're calling me! S.O.B.
Listen to me. Hey, shithead. Lose my fucking number, you dumb fuck.
I'm gonna call in some favors and bring a vice grips in there.

Save you some money on your monthly bill, I can give some new functions as well. Have you got 30 seconds to add...
No, I don't, ah, need anything else with my phone.
I'm sorry?
I don't need anything else with the phone. It's fine.
How about just givin' me a shot at it. Gimme 30 seconds of your time, Mr. Fuddle.
I don't, I don't need anything else. I got everything. I got call waiting and that's all I need.
For $4.40, we give every other service we have.
Yeah, well that's, uh...for $4.40 I can make some more calls.
Calling to let you know about Telechoice. We're offering a discount billling package for your phone line.
I'm fed up. Please take me off your list. And don't call us back.
Can you give me 30 seconds of your time?
No, I can't.
It's a sensational...
Just take me off your list! This is the
third god damned call
I've had
today
. And I'm
tired
of it!
Well it's a sensational offer.
Telechoice will go one your line the 8th of October.
M'kay, this is under AT&T, right?
Uh, US West. Just...we're a local company. Right.
US West, "ASOS"...
Cause I don't want any odd little creatures...
Yeah, you don't wanna take on anymore companies.
Some po'dunk companies I've never heard of...yeah, clicking into a- [tone]
You already have US West.
Well, ok, but I ain't...I've been gettin' calls about changing and everything. Well, maybe it's AT&T or something or other...
Helo?
Hi, is Mr. Ding there?
Uh...he's not home now, okay?
Your mother-in-law?
Oh, yes, she hates me. [laughing] Trust me, she hates me.
Your mother-in-law feels that way? Why?
'Cause I took her son away!
Oh...but just, just...don't call her in three way.
Well...I only did it because I wanted to see the way she felt, and...then she lied about it but...my mother-in-law, I mean...she should be in a mental institution, 'cause she's a whacko. She really...well, she's from Nebraska, so, you know, their all backwards out there, anyways, [laughing] but...
Oh.
So trust me, it's nothing off my back. Seriously, with my phone bill...I mean, check my records. I live in Port Orchard. My husband works in Bangor, and that's long distance.
Yeah...
And it's only a 20 minute drive. So I called US West, and they said because...Bangor is on another phone company line...that's why it's long distance. So I think it's stupid. Two, I hate the state of Washington, so...I hate it!
Oh, c'mon...
Oh, I hate it! I really miss the snow. Here, it stinks.
Who are you? Who are you? I can't understand English.
Hi, this is US West, how're ya doin'?
Ah, I don't know...I haven't taken an inventory this morning. I woke up this mornin'. Uh...I tell you what, you call back maybe in a half an hour or so, and talk to the warden; she takes care of all that.
We're calling to let you know about Telechoice, that we're offering...
Huh? That costs $6.50...
Well, why should I pay extra money?
Well, you're getting 3-way calling and call...
I'm not interested in the 3-way calling.
We don't have any use for it. We don't need a 3-way hook-up!
I just got out of the hospital with a brand new... knee re-emplacement. And uh, I...just rather not switch at this time.
It's only...one dollar and fifty cents, Frank...per month. And then you'll have 3-way...
Yeah, one dollar and fifty cents, I might...don't have it!
You...
I...how we gonna do it? Don't have it! No, let's...let, w...let's do it the way we been doing.

[snorts]

Phone ringing
Hello, this is George.
Hi, I'm Remington from Citysearch.com and uh... I'm calling uh... to extend uh... offer to you and your business... It's negative comment reversal, where we can actually reverse negative comments made about your establishment and... it's costing you just a grand total of thirteen-hundred dollars.
You know what, I'll be okay buddy. I'm not interested.
I just need a credit card number from you.
I said I'm okay. I'm not interested. Okay?
But this is negativity about your company.
No. If someone's gonna write something negative about me anyways, they can kiss my ass anyways. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't bother me at all.
Money order or check?
[Laugh] What part are you not listening to? I don't care if they put negative stuff like that.
Citysearch.com. You mean you're gonna get cyber-bullied?
Nah. I'm okay.
Gonna get cyber-bullied, huh?
I'm okay. I'll be okay.
There's three comments, sir!
I understand and... I'm okay--
You don't wanna rectify things, huh?
No, I'm ok--
This is plucked out of today's headlines, is what it is.
It'll be ok.

Kiss my ass.
The changes take effect within twenty-four hours.
I don't care. I'm not even on the internet anyways. So, that doesn't matter to me.
You got a bogus web pager, er...
No... I'm okay.
What if I left a negative comment on you.
Uh... Then go ahead, but that's not vey business-like to be trying to get my business and you tell me you're gonna put something negative? That makes no sense at all.
Why don't you just... compromise. It's all about compromise.
You're starting to get on my nerves now, okay?
[Phone ringing]

Okay, umm... Is this-- What kind of item is it? What are you bringing down here?
Well, I don't know. Gravel or somethin'.
Gravel? You're bring gravel down? This is, uh-- I'm on the road right now.
Okay. Well, let me start over for ya. We need a signature, we need a check--
Is this for Edward Mahoney?
UPS.
Yeah, but what's-- what's the client's name? The customer's name?
It's-- I-- It's on the package. I can't see it from here. I'm on the dock.
Mmm. Alright.
So, we need a certified check today in the amount of fourteen hundred and eighty-two dollars even.
You know what, we have-- There's gotta be a mistake, buddy. Because I wouldn't order anything for fourteen hundred dollars. Now w-- what would I need gravel for? You know who you're talking to?
That's none of my concern. Oliver-- Do you know who Oliver is? Our driver?
No. I have no idea.
Well, you're gonna meet him in about ten, fifteen minutes.
I'm gonna meet him at-- at-- at-- at where I'm at right now?
Wherever you are. It's on the label. I can't see it from here. I'm workin' here.
I understand. Uhhh, there's gotta be some sort of mistake. Because I'm Eddy Money the singer. And I'm at the
Mohegan Sun
right now. Gettin' ready to do a show. Now there's-- I wouldn't have any reason in the world to buy gravel, buddy.
Well, I think you made the mistake if you... changed your mind on the product... or whatever.
No. I don't think I bought any-- I really-- I don't think I bought any-- any kind of product at all. What d'you guys sell?
Well, I can promise you that you did. I'm looking at a digital signature.
Edward Mahoney?
I've worked here for twenty-four years now.
What do you guys sell out there.
United Parcel Service. We deliver parcels all day long and you're making that real difficult right now.
I really don't mean to do that, sir. I have no idea. I gotta get ready to go on. I-- I don't know what-- what to tell you or... somebody's coming over to pick up a check. Is he gonna come and give me the check-- I gotta sign the check on stage... in fifteen minutes?
You can cut me a check--
I don't really understand what's going on here. I really don't. Close everything up.
I'll tell you what--
[Hang up]
[Rigning]
Hello?
Yeah. Hi. This is Oliver. Uh, UPS.
Oliver, this is Eddie Money. I really don't know what you're talking about. I've got a lady here that deals with UPS. She's coming downstairs right now. But I have no-- I don't see any reason why I'd order fourteen hundred dollars worth of gravel, buddy.
You can send an online--
[?] would I need gravel?
What's up?
[To the lady who deals with UPS] Talk to this guy.
You can send an online pay--
[Lady] Hello?
Yeah. Hi. I w--
Who is this?
I'm Oliver. United Parcel Service.
Uh huh.
I was just in the process of getting a credit card number.
Getting a credit card number?
Yeah.

For, uh, C.O.D. this fella ordered here.
What is the product or whatever?
I'm with UPS.
Right.
Right. It's from--
What s-- What-- Wh-- C.O.D. for what?
Uh, it's, uh, fourteen hundred pounds of gravel.
Fourteen hundred pounds of gravel?
Give or take a hundred pounds. Yeah.
[Eddie Money in background] Is it going here or the house in LA or Florida?
For... J-- For... In Florida or in California? Where's the gravel going?
It's going to a residence.
[Eddie Money] [?]
Well, I know. But.. We have-- You've got the wrong UPS number or something.
Uhhh, I'm looking at a digital signature.
Of... Ed Mahoney?
I can't make it out but it authorized the charge, so...
Where are we supposed to dump this stuff?
[Eddie Money] Don't bother bringing it.
Don't bring it. I don't know where you're gonna--
Well, we're-- W're here. There's a lady standing here. I don't know what to tell her.
[A blaring saxophone can be heard in the background]
Okay. Where are you... with... the gravel?
I'm sitting at the residence. There's a lady here yelling at me. I don't know what to tell her.
[Saxophone continues to be audible in the background]
I mean, where are you with the gravel?
I'm in my vehicle.
I mean, where are you gon-- Where are you wanting to dump it?... In Los Angeles?
Thereabouts. Yeah. I don't know exactly I'm just a-- Do you want to talk to this woman or is-- She wants to talk--
Yes.
--to hi--
Okay. I'll take her. Go ahead.
I can't-- I can't reach that far.
But-- He has no idea what it's for.
If you just tell him to give me the credit card number, we'll authorize the delivery and we'll be done.
But he doesn't want it.
Well--
He doesn't know where it's going or what it's for.
It's a little late... to change his mind. We're already sittin' here with, uh-- I just drove forty miles.
I need the address of where you're actually going to dump it.
I got-- I got a puppy dog running around chasing people around out here.
[Pause]
[Long sigh]
He's a singer. He's he's not home. He doesn't know where-- who ordered the gravel or anything.
Can you tell him there's a puppy dog running around here... snappin' at stuff?
What's the lady's name out there that's yelling at you?
L- Lorraine.
Lorraine?
What's her last name?
I don't-- She won't tell me. We've got gravel spilling out and dogs running around and ladies...
She says there's a lady--
... hopping up and down...
--yelling at him and there's dogs running around. Her name's Lorraine.
[Eddie Money] I don't know what he's talking about.
He's in Los Angeles.
I'm here at the property. I'm ready to make the shipment to deliver it.
Hang on. He's calling his wife. Just a hang on.
[Eddie Money] (hard to understand) - I can't call my wife on this phone. 1400 pounds of gravel?
Where is she gonna put it? (hard to hear background noise) Here Ed. There, dial.
Can you just have him call off the dogs please, ma'am?
[Eddie Money] 1400 pounds of gravel?
Yeah, he said 'Just have him call off the dogs'. How are you gonna call off the dogs? Have that lady call off the dogs, we're in Connecticut.
She's not cooperating.
The lady won't call off the dogs.
[Eddie Money] It's only a basset hound (unintelligible).
Is it a basset hound?
I can't say for sure, it's snappin' and yappin' at me. (pause) Would you tell him this thing's snappin' and yappin'?
Pardon me? (unintelligible) Do what?
Would you just tell him that this dog is snappin' and yappin' at me?
[Eddie Money] I have no idea, she doesn't know anything about any gravel.
It isn't his wife. You've got a wrong number, wrong address, wrong something.
Like hell I do. I'm lookin' right at a puppy dog.
Well, you might be looking at a dog, but it's not hi...wha...can you give me a physical address?
This...this gravel is aquamarine in color, and it's real heavy. And it's...
It's aquamarine colored gravel?
[Eddie Money] Aqua, did you order aqua, did you order aquamarine colored gravel, Laurie? No, right? I don't think I ordered that from Florida either.
They're in L.A. with it, they're sitting in front of the house looking at a dog.
[Eddie Money] They're sitting in front of a house in L.A. looking at a dog. Are you home in L.A. Laurie? I don't know (unintelligible) I gotta go, I'll see you later.
You got the...You got the wrong number.
It's real hot out here, this dog is snapping at me. What do you suggest I do?
Uh, find out the real physical address that you need to deliver it to, because...
I'm sitting here, I just need a credit card number.
But you've got the wrong person. He's going on stage right now. he a singer, he, his show is starting right now. He cannot talk again for two hours.
(sigh) I need a signature, and I need a check, and I need someone to leash this thing up here. Before I set foot out there.
Right, but you're not at...Who are you trying, who do you think you're talking to?
I don't know who I'm talking to ma'am.
Ok, you've obviously...I'm not trying to be rude to you, you're just doing your job, I understand that. But you've got a wrong number. We are in Connecticut, his wife is in California, but you are at the wrong address. I mean you might be at the right address, but you've got the wrong number to pay for it.
Ok, uh, well we'll just send it back to the dock.
Yeah, send it back and if they, whoever it belongs to can call you, because you really got the wrong number.
Ok, thank you.
Uh huh, bye.
(Hang up sound)

Hello?
Hello, this is, uh, Archie over at UPS. How are ya?
Archie? What, is this about the gravel again? Is that what you're gonna hit me with?
No, no, no. No, no.
The aqua gravel, is that what this is all about?
We got...(sigh) What we've got is, we've got about fifteen hundred pounds of peat moss out here, that we're stuck with.
Buddy boy, let me explain something to you. I never ordered any peat moss. I'm divorced from my fucking wife. She's got the house, I live in the Motel 6. There's no way in the world i was gonna turn around and order fucking fourteen hundred pounds of peat moss for my ex-wife. You guys are, you, you're outta your mind! I had nothing to do with this bill. Nothing! You guys are delivering to the wrong house. Where are you delivering this peat moss to?
Well, I can't see it from here, but uh...
WAIT A MINUTE! You keep talking you can't see it from here. You don't fucking see it, and you can't find out where the fuck it's going, why the fuck are you calling me back? Every time you assholes call me, you tell me 'I can't see the package'. Leave me the fuck alone, will ya?
Wha...How about just cutting a check for us?
(ring)
Hello?
Yeah, hello, this is uh, Ernie at UPS. I'm an administrator out here. And I uhh, looking at a balance due here...and I wanted to touch base on it.
(pause) Is this regarding the aqua gravel?
Well, it's, ahhh, I got it marked as manure, or something or other, I don't know.
Well, you know what? Look, I never ordered that, and this is the fifth phone call I've gotten from UPS on this thing. I have not ordered any aqua gravel, I don't need aqua gravel for anything, and you guys keep calling me and bugging me about this aqua gravel. I never ordered this aqua gravel, aqua gravel. You will not find my name, you will not find my signature, you won't find my wife's signature, and you won't even tell me where the gravel's going to. Everytime I ask you where the gravel's going to, you go 'Oh, the box is on the other side of the room'. Where do you got the gravel going to?
Well I'm on the dock, sir.
Well, well,we...you know, you can't keep calling me up and telling me 'you got fourteen hundred,' you guys are so goddamn fucking unprofessional, I can't believe it. So go fuck yourself!
Well how about an online payment?
(hang up sound)
(ring)
Hello?...HELLO!?!
Yeah, you got United Parcel here, pardner...Anybody there?
Excuse me?
You got United Parcel calling. (pause) And uh, according to my notes, we are in need of an online payment from you, at this time.
You know what, good buddy?
What's that?
You better call somebody else now, and stop bugging me about something I never fucking ordered. Gimme the address where it says you're sending it to! Come on wise ass! Come on, you never gave me the address of the, of, of anything about this thing. You're full of shit. You better leave me alone, or I'll trace this phone call and call the cops and have you guys arrested. You got that?
(sigh) I think that...
(unintelligible) you stupid shithead! Leave me the fuck alone!

Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Do you understand me?
Hello?

Hello?
Hello, how are you sir?
You go to hell, okay? You go to hell! Don't call me again here! Go to hell!
You tell me how to wake up, and I haven't do anything, brush my teeth? You tell me right away, get out here? Don't fucking yell at me, okay? Just call the police, come over here! Just go ahead and call the FBI and...police! If you don't call the police, I will call the police of lawyers, okay? You know what? I haven't even brushed my teeth, let me tell you sir! Get the FUCK out here. Call the police right now, talk to them!
Hello?
Yeah, hello. This is Thrasher here at, uh, United Parcel Service.
Yeah?
And, ah... need a signature and a COD here today on, uh... on some freight here.
What is it?
Ah...
Where is it from, do you know?
We got, uh, some sod here.
Sod?
Yes.
Are you sure you have the right address?
Quite confident. Our driver is already en route to you. I just, ah... just as soon get the, uh... payment prepared now.
Well, who ordered it?
It's, uh, nineteen-hundred and forty-nine dollars even.
Well, who ordered it?
Uh, you're the recipient.
Well, we're the recipient, but we didn't order it.
Incorrect. You placed the initial order and now we're fulfilling it. Do you understand?
When did we place the order? I'm the owner of the house here and I didn't place the order, so you tell me who placed the order. If it's our gardener - and he didn't tell us about it - I don't know and I don't know where we need sod. So, you tell me where this is coming from.
I am looking at your digital signature...
Digital signature?
Here on my tablet. Yes, sir. Need an online payment or some method of payment here, four-forty-nine...
Well, where did you get my digital signature?
From you.
When?
At the time of purchase.
And where was the purchase made?
Siam.
Siam?
Correct. I...
The country Siam?
That's all the data I have, sir.
Uh...
Apparently this is the third attempt here.
And this is sod?
Yes, sir.
Grass?
Something to do with the lawn, yeah. It's a big, big bundle of stuff here.
Well, I don't... you don't have my digital signature because I didn't give you my digital signature. I didn't order anything from Siam and Siam is no longer in existence. It's Thailand now, so I don't know what Siam is.
Well, the whole thing is viewable online.
The whole thing is viewable online.
Your signature, the... the item itself... it's a real colorful bunch of stuff here.
Yeah.
And, uh, the payment details. So, if I can go ahead and take a credit card number here and we'll just get everything, uh...
No, you're not going to take a credit card number at all because, uh... tell me where I can view this online.
UPS dot com.
UPS dot com and then we, uh, go to what?
You need to just enter your credit card number as soon as possible.
Uh, I ain't gonna do that... 'cause, uh, we didn't order anything. So...
You're not gonna do it on forty-two hundred pounds of stuff, here?
Forty-two hundred pounds of stuff? Are you out of your mind?
That is roughly the weight of this stuff here.
Well, we didn't order it.
We got four trucks en route to you.
[Sigh] Well... too bad 'cause... they ain't delivering it here.
Oh no?
Nope. [Laughs] You're not UPS, so...
[Scoffs] Most certainly am, twelve years on the job I've been here.
Oh yeah? What's your name?
I'm on the dock right here. I'm Wallace.
Wallace what?
Thrasher.
Wallace Thrasher... okay. What's the number out there? Who's the supervisor?
I'm the only one on the dock, sir.
You're the only one?
The only one on the dock here tonight, yes, sir.
Oh yeah? Why are we delivering this at night?
Like I say, this is... third or fourth try here to get this to you.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, this is the first time we've heard of it. So...
Is that a fact?
We have a normal... a usual driver who comes here and, uh... he never mentioned anything about it. We don't have... where's Mom? Get Mom. I'm gonna get my wife here and find out if you've, uh...
Well why don't you come down to the dock?
Huh?
Just cut a check or however you do it.
Where is the dock?
I'm in Calabasas right now.
Calabasas? So, you want me to come out to Calabasas to view something that I didn't order and that I probably don't want?
Twelve years of working here, I've seen lots and lots of digital signatures come and go.
Really?
Lots of them.
Yeah, well, I don't buy things with digital signatures. So... do we have... there's forty-two hundred pounds of sod or something on... or that's about to be delivered with four trucks from UPS. Did we order that? No.
Sir, I have been told by my, uh, colleague here... we can accept cash and coins to get this thing resolved here for you.
I think this is just a crock of shit, so... you're not UPS.
Absolutely am here.
Yeah, well, I'll ask my driver tomorrow to track down a Wallace Thrasher.
You can call me Stretchy.
You're just not gonna give up, are you... Stretchy.
I just deal with fulfillment, product fulfillment here at United Parcel Service, so... we've got... a total of three flags on your account here, so... I just would like to get a routing number and we'll satisfy the debt.
I don't have a routing number. How am I going to have a routing number? What the hell is a routing number?
From your checking account or debit card or...
Are you out of your mind? I'm going to pay two thousand dollars for something that I do not have, did not order, and know nothing about?
The sender's name is Artie Yamamoto.
Send me something in the mail, Stretch.
I'll send you a subpoena is what I'll send you.
Oh, that's good. I'll respond to a subpoena.
You'll be commanded to testify before Artie Yamamoto.
Oh, good. Boy, that scares me. Artie Yamamoto? Who is he?
He's at the... Bangkok Sod Center.
Bangkok Sod Center... and that's in Bangkok, Thailand?
Yes, sir.
Oh, good. Yup, I'm likely to order sod from... [laughs] Thailand. You're outta your mind, Stretchy.
Well, let's hop on a plane and we'll go, uh, meet with him in person, have a three-way conference.
Are you out of your mind?
No. [laughs] I resent the implication, frankly.
Well, good. Um, resent it all you want. Send me a letter. Send me a subpoena. I'll be happy to receive it.
We'll do a conference call.
No, I don't need a conference call, Stretchy.
You can call me Stretchy. I mean...
I just did.
I've got signed affidavits and...
Affidavits?
All kinds of other things, yes, sir.
Well, good. Well, you have my signature?
I'm looking right at it.
Yeah? And what does it say?
It's not legible.
It's not legible?
So, that would be step one is to work on that, but...
I have no need for two thousand dollars' worth of sod and I didn't order it and I know nothing about it.
So, you thought you'd just stick good old UPS with the charges, huh?
Nope. Are you out of your mind? Nobody orders sod from Asia. Send me something in the mail and, uh... we'll get to the bottom of this, but we're not paying for something we didn't order.
Oh, you and I will get to the bottom of it all right if I need to come down and drive the truck myself.
Oh, well go ahead. Be prepared to be met by police.
Be prepared about...

(Woman) Hello?
Hello there.
(Woman) Hold on. (In background) Here.
(Rick) I'm trying, I can't see anything to turn it on and off. Hello?
Yes sir, this is Axelrod up here at United Parcel Service.

Hi there. Uh, I'm an administrator out here. Looks like we need a check prepared tonight, and we've got three trucks on our way...to you, with some, ah, peat moss out here. So just need...
(Rick) Peat Moss?
Yes sir.
(Rick) I think you must have the wrong number, or something. I don't think we...(woman yells something in background). We didn't order any moss.
It's twenty-three hundred pounds.
(Rick) Twenty-three hundred pounds? Nope. (Lady in background: "Sorry!").
We just need a check drafted. It's, uh, nineteen-hundred and twelve dollars.
(Rick) Nineteen-hundred and twelve dollars?
Yes.
(Rick) We didn't order it. (Lady in background: "Peat moss...") Not us.
I see...
(Lady in background: "That's crazy, it says private number".)
I see the digital signature right here.
(Rick) From whom?
You're the recipient.
(Rick) From whom?
It's from Indonesia.
(Rick) Indonesia? Twenty-three hundred pounds? Ah, you must be joking. And who is the name on the, uh, digital signature?
Sincerely not jokin' with you, I've been here fourteen years. Ahhhh, United Parcel Service.
(Rick) Who is the number on the digital...I mean...who is the name on the digital signature?
Ahh, my name's Axelrod.
(Rick) No, no, the name on the...
Yes it is.
(Rick) ...signature you said.
You can verify it.
(Rick) No, I ask the name on the signature. Who is it to?
It's all viewable online right now.
(Rick) Uhmmm..
But...
(Rick) I, I'm, you still haven't told me to, who it's to. (Lady in background: "So he's a liar...".).
It's, It's from, um, Indonesia. It's to Richard, I can't make out the...
(Rick) Richard? I'm not a Richard.
It's not legible.
(Rick) And what is the, uh, website that I am to go to to see it?
UPS dot com.
(Rick) Okay, hold on, I'll pull it up while you're on here.
I just need a credit card number, sir.
(Rick) I'm not gonna give you a credit card until I (laughs)... I haven't ordered anything from Indonesia.
Well then a routing number.
(Rick) (Laughs) I won't give ya a routing number either.
Why not?
(Rick) I'm not gonna pay twenty-three hundred dollars for something I did not order.
I can verify ya that ya did place the order. That's not even, you know...in question.
(Rick) ...If I did place the order, could you verify it? Okay, I'm going to United States, UPS dot com. And I look for what?
You can look for my picture.
(Rick) Look for your picture?
Yeah. And enter the, enter your routing number right below it.
(Rick) I don't know what you're talking about.
Get, get me the funds, that we need.
(Rick) I'm looking at UPS dot com, right now, and there are no photos of you. (Laughs).
There most certainly are! There's two or three of them.
(Woman in background talking) What did you say, sir?
I'm in a kayak in one of them. So, all you need to do...is find that photo, that's step one.
(Woman in background says something about "private number").
What is that young woman, uh, speaking about? This is Axelrod, at UPS dot com.
(Woman) No, it's not Axelrod at UPS dot com. You're trying to fraud us. What is you're phone number so I can call you right back?
I'm trying to what now?
(Woman) What is your phone number?
Ah one eight...
(Woman) And I'll, my husband will call you right back.
Not a problem.
(Woman) What is it?
Not a problem whatsoever, young lady.
(Woman) Okay, what is it? You don't know your number?
Do you want the number?
(Woman) Yeah!
Yeah, that's not an issue at all.
(Woman) Go ahead.
I'm ready anytime you are.
(Woman) I gotta pen.
Let's do it.
(Woman) Go ahead.
One eight-hundred Pick UPS.
(Woman) Pick UPS?
Take your pick, I need a routing number, a credit card number, a paypal payment, any of the above, and we'll just straighten this out.
(Woman) You, you're just really hilarious. Where did you get our number?
Ahhhhh, from the sod center, that you placed the order from.
(Woman) We don't...hav...We don't order sod.
Wha, where does the truck go? Could you just tell us that much?
(Woman) No.
To the back? To the front? To the side?
(Woman) Why should I tell you where the truck goes, when I don't know where it would go. Where we would drop that off.
To the side? To the front? To the back?
(Woman) To the side, to the front, to the back. You are just too much. Just get off of it, and go bother somebody else, please. Our ringers are already off, sorry 'private number'.

Hi.
Hello?
Yes, I was calling about my overalls? I've got a bunch of overalls. I've also got 72 bandanas.
[laughs] 72 bandanas?
From Wyoming.
OK, so are you looking to sell these bandanas or...what?
I want you to, uh, more or less appraise them and tell me what they're worth. I'll pay you for the appraisal, um...it will be an amount that I decide, that decision will be final, OK; and you'll abide by it. So, uh...
And I'll abide by it? Excuse me?
Yeah, so...how much am I looking to get here, probably?
Uh, well, sight unseen I can't really tell you anything.
Well, give it a shot.
That's impossible for me to do. How do you expect me to give you a price on something i haven't seen?
Well, they're like Bojangles-style.
Bojangles-style? I have no idea what you're talking about.
I...think you do. I mean, I'm the one calling you.
No, i'm going to hang up the phone.
So why don't you try a little harder?
Excuse me?
Overalls, pal.
OK, listen buddy, I'm hanging up the phone now.
[calls back]
Squaresville.
Yeah, I needed some, uhm, back patches..
OK, is this the same guy that just called right now?
No no, no no.
No no? Your voice sounds exactly the same.
Well, how much is like, a back patch?
[breaking glass SFX]
How much is a backpack? [breaking glass] I don't know, anywhere from $5 to $100.
OK, I need a hundred back patches.
You need a hundred backpacks?
Yeah.
You're going to have to call somebody else.
Well, you're going to have to accommodate me. Period. End of discussion.
Listen, motherfucker, if you call here one more time, making demands from me...
[hangs up]
...-ville?
Yeah, do you guys do appraisals?
Look, you need to stop fucking calling this store. I ain't got time for this mess.
Do you do appraisals, yes or no?
No, we don't do appraisals.
Why not?
Because that's not our job. That's not what we do.
I'll come to you. How's that?
No. You're not going to come to anybody. You need to stop calling me, you're wasting my fucking time.
You're wasting mine right now.
I'm wasting your time, huh?
Period, end of sentence. Yeah, what part didn't ya-
End of sentence is stop fucking talking, buddy. Stop calling my store.
I got overalls, I got bandanas, I got everything...
I don't give a fuck what you have, I don't give a fuck what you're all about, you need to stop calling my store because you're getting on my fucking nerves.
Take a look at what I'm wearing!
Take a look at what you're-man, shut the...

Hello?
[shaking tambourine in background]
Hi.
Hello?
This is, ah...Giannini, how you doing?
What can I do for you, Giannini?
Yes...I work for Isotoner Gloves.
Yeah, well...wonderful. That's very, very exciting for you..I think you've got the wrong number, sweetheart.
No...we need someone to..to...show off our gloves. Model our gloves.
You work for Isotoner Gloves, Gino...what's your name again, babe?
Giannini.
Great. [unintelligible]...Isotoner Gloves, and you want someone to show off your gloves. How much money do you want to pay, and how real are you, you're full-I'm not buying this, Giannini.
Not buying it? Well, how about to the tune of $1,800?
$1,800...you need a guy or a girl?
We need a gal.
You need a guy...and you are...so let me have the number where you can be reached, at the company.
My direct line is 123-4567...and the event is on the 12th of this month.
But your number is 123-4567..what's your area code, babe?
It's 000.
So...I've never heard of such a number, dear.
Well, that's my direct line, so...
So if someone were to dial 000-123-4567, they'd you reach you, right?
Well, yeah. This is Isotoner Gloves. maybe you've heard of us, maybe you haven't...but, uhm...I can s-
I've heard of you, of course I've heard of you, but I've never heard of area code-well, I'm calling you right now, babe. Let's see how you do.
Have you ever heard of Colibri Lighters?
Yes. I've heard of Isotoner Gloves, I've never heard of Colibri Lighters...
I use Colibri Lighters, I use Isotoner Gloves...
Honey, you're calling me from a blocked number, and you just gave me a number that doesn't work, so, so far...
That is not true. That is
not
true. I'm ready to s-...yeah.
Listen to me. Call me back and open your line up and we'll talk about doing some business, okay?
I'll send you PayPal, half of the amount. Up front.
Well, I don't understand why you don't have a number, honey.
I just gave it to you.
I just dialed it from another number, I'm sitting here with two assistants.
Yeah?
And we just dialed 000-124567.
No, it's 12
We dialed it. [unintelligible]
Let me have your e-mail address, and I'll shoot you a payment right now.
Yeah, your number doesn't work, babe, why would I give you my email? I've got six email addresses and I'd be happy to give you one, but there's no payment because you don't have a number [unintelligible]...you don't exist with your Isotoner Gloves.
All I need-...
Call me back from a real number, let me figure out if you're real, and we'll talk. It's just not enough money for me to sit here and let you entertain yourself, OK?
You need to be able to use a lighter. That's the only stipulation.
I think you better go back to doing the drugs that you just finished off before you called me, OK?
What is that supposed to mean?
[accent]
I'm looking for a dancer around here.
There's no dancers around here, you should really stop calling this number.
Either a model, or a singer or a da-
No, no models, no singers, no dancers, no nothing, stop calling this number.
I heard you a pretty good dancer, over here.
Who the hell is this, is this Carlos?
This is Giannini.
I don't know you, you don't know us...you should really stop calling this number before I report it or block you.
I wanna do a little dancing tonight, how's that sound?
Well, you go ahead and do your dancing, call somebody else, stop fucking with us.
Please enjoy the music while your party is reached.
[Jungleland continues playing]
[chuckles]
Prophet.
Hi. I was needing to hire a spokesperson, as soon as possible.
Would you introduce yourself, please?
I am Giannini, I am with Isotoner Gloves...
Right, you're the same fucking retard that called me yesterday, OK? Lose my number, okay? You don't have a business deal, you're an obsessed fan and a stalker, and frankly; you're boring. You're not even a
good
fugazy, alright? You're a fucking retard.
Let me fit your hand with our gloves, and you'll change your tune, I bet you.
Why-yeah, you don't have any gloves. You're-either that, you're one of the most ridiculously verbal human beings ever. Your brain and your mouth don't match up, okay? Spoke to you yesterday and you gave me a wrong fucking number, you're a moron. Isotoner gloves and lighters, and all the rest of your bullshit. Tell it to somebody that actually gives a shit, you
stalker-fucker-loser

Hello? Yes, this is Mister Freebus, I'm a retro-style hang glider, and I need some photographs taken.
What was your name?
Mister Freebus.
Ah, Jesus..what now, dude? You're Mister Freebus now, what happened to old Jacques? You were Jacques last time, and before that you were something else.
Who's this?
Uh, dude, I'm really over this shit, I'm sick of it. You can take your rockabilly skydiving ass off a fucking cliff, OK? Leave me the fuck alone.
Yeah, I just need some snapshots taken, pronto.
I don't take snapshots, dickhead.
Well, I hang glide, and I want some photos taken. And I'm retro. So...
[interrupting]
You're retro?
...deal with it.
Backward? Deal with it? Is that what you just said, 'deal with it'?
Yeah. Just take the snapshots, and we'll be done...prick.
Who are you, dude? What do you want with me? Do you know me? Is there something I did to you? Is there something you need from me? I don't understand why you keep choosing me. Or, do you have a roster of fucking people you call and prank? I mean, I don't understand. Are you getting off? Is your dick in your hand right now? Are you stroking yourself while you're talking to me? Are you gay? Are you looking for some kind of homosexual relationship? What is the point of this? Are you stalking me? Are you gonna kill me? Come fucking do it already, dude. Stop fucking calling me, I really don't need to hear from you anymore. I could have easily blocked your stupid number, but I didn't because I..I've got this weird curiosity about who the fuck you are.
I'm Mister Freebus.
You're Mister Freebish?
I am a hang glider, and I'm...got a retro style, and I want some photographs taken.
Here, take this, Michael, please. I gotta go kick go fucking kick this dude's ass out front. Alright, dude. I want to meet you out front, right now. Come meet me, right now. Get your ass outside now, bitch. Come on. I'll snapshot your ass right now.
Okay.
Step outside.
I'll be there.
Yep. Where are you?
I'm in Monrovia, right now.
Where you think I am, right now?
You're going to be in a world of hurt.
Before I get into this "world of hurt," where am I right now?
I don't know! What are you talking about?
What are you talking about, Mister Feevish, whatever the fuck your name is?
Mister Freebus.
Alright Mr. Freebus, what is your address?
It's 414 Mammoth Court.
There's no Mammoth Court in Monrovia. You're tripping.
[sighs]
You're pissing me off, dude.
I'm pissing
you
off? Really? Did I call you?
Probably.
Oh, probably? Alright, well, I'm glad I'm pissing you off, because you are making my day. I am a happy camper, speaking to my good friend, Mister Feevish.
Why are you so happy?
Because you just bring joy to me. Mr. Freebish, what is my name?
I don't know.
You don't know? Where did you get my number?
I saw it on a wall, and there was..it said you took photos.
Tell me, where, what wall did you find my number on?
I got a retro style, I hang glide, and I need pro shots taken, period; end of sentence.
I'll do it all, but you gotta answer my questions, first. I have an interview process, if you don't want to answer these questions, then you can go ahead and jump out of any plane you want. Answer my fucking question: where did you get my number?
In Monrovia.
My number's not in Monrovia. I've never been in Monrovia, fuckhead. Come on, tell me, what wall did you get my number on? That's what you said last time, by the way, you didn't say Monrovia. You said a different area. Where did you get my number?
I don't know if you're running like a cloak-and-dagger kind of operation, or what you're doing, but...
That's exactly what I'm doing. I work for President Bush. I run a cloak-and-dagger situation, here. I work for the Opus Dei, and the Skull and Bones. That's who I work for, so..you still wanna fuck with me now, dude?
Psh...
Why don't you take my number and lose it?
Why don't you shove it?
I'd love to shove it, I'd love to shove it. In fact, I shove it best. That's what I fucking do best. can you lose my number?
Dude, just take the pictures already.
Dude, leave me the
fuck
alone.
[Ringing]
Hello?
Yeah, this is Monroe at Tuff Shed... and, uhh... We're gonna be out there at seven-thirty A.M. to take dimensions and everything.
Uhhh. You gotta have the wrong number.
No. I don't.
[Burps]
And you're with Tuff Shed?
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm-
[laughs]
Monroe, I'm tellin' ya. This is really weird. Because, uh, why would I want a Tuff Shed when- when that's what we do. We build sheds. We're
Sheds by WW Jones.
Our home--
You wanna se how I do it. Is that it?
No! I have no--
Well get in line.
I mean... Somebody somewhere has done something, because I've never even talked bad about Tuff Shed. Nothing. Ever.
[Laughing]
I don't-- I don't
want
a shed! If I wanted a shed, I've got a whole yard full of shed. I don't want a shed.
You want us to demolish the ones you've got?
[Laughing] No. Are you serious? I have not called you, Monroe. I promise you. I have not ordered
anything
from you. I've-- I mean, I've been havin' weird calls at my work too.
What do you gotta say about Tuff Shed?
I don't have
anything
bad to say about Tuff Shed. I have
never
said anything bad about Tuff Shed.
You wanna see how I do it. Just admit it.
I
don't
wanna see how you do it. We've been doing it longer than
you
Listen. I'm gonna come out there. I'm gonna spec ya out. I'm gonna take
all
your measurements. Up down and all around. And then we're gonna get everything erected. How's that sound?
[Laughing]
I did not order it. I didn't do it. I don't do this kind of stuff. And if wanna come down here, you're not gonna erect a shed on my property. I'm telling you that right now.
I'll be there... bright and early.
You be here at my house at seven-thirty, my tired ass is still gonna be in bed -
Lady, this is Monroe-
- and If I were you, I would not start erecting any kinda shed.
Oh, no?
What address are you gonna do this?
Well, the specified place.
If you come here and build a shed- You're not allowed on my property. Do not come on my property. 'Cause you don't even know where the hell I live with this "specified place" that you have. Whatever! Just don't come to my house and erect "a shed", as you say, because I'm not gonna pay you for it.
Oh!
Apparently, you don't even know where I live because this 'specified location' that you have-- Just don't wake me up, 'cause I will not be awake at seven-thirty in the morning.
Who is this?
Monroe.
[Laughing]
I've heard that "Monroe" crap. Monroe, I've never even talked to you. I've never said anything bad about Tuff Shed. But if you come to my house and erect a shed at seven-thirty in the morning, I feel sorry for you.
O
h, really?
Yeah.
Let me talk to your husband.
[Speaker on the phone is now the husband]
Hello?
Hi. This is Monroe at Tuff Shed.
Hey Monroe. How you doin'?... I say how are you doin'?
It's just a courtesy call that we'll be out there at seven-thirty bright and early tomorrow to get your specs for your, uh, Tuff Shed.
I think you've got a mistake there.
We're gonna be there at seven-thirty
A.M.
tomorrow to take your measurements. Get you spec-ed out--
You're gonna be here at seven-thirty in the mornin' and you gon' be in jail at eight o'clock.
Why's that?
I haven't signed nothin' from Tuff Shed. I
am
a shed company. We
own
a shed company. WW Jones Incorporated. Been there for
years and years and years
I've been on the job for twelve years.
Well you need to go a little while longer! I've been in the same location for thirty-eight years. And I ain't got nothin' against Tuff Shed. Don't get me wrong. But I don't need a shed built here at my place.
Well then I need a deposit at the very least. I'm through doin' things on spec for you people. We got ladies callin' me up and tellin' me this and that and-
My lady didn't call you- Er, you called her.
What are ya, wacky?
No! You the fuckin' one's
wacky
Listen, man--
I'm trying to tell you, sir, I'm a shed manufacturin' company and I get along with Tuff Sheds, so I ain't got nothing bad to say about you whatsoever.
None
. We're both in the shed business but we ain't order no shed.
(Wife can be heard in the background, presumably speaking on the phone with shed clients and/or Tuff Shed representatives)
We want a shed, we've got sheds. I've got a hundreds of 'em settin'. I've got fuckin' sheds if I wanted one.

I'm gonna fax you three pages in a row, right now.
No, not three pages! That's too much!
[music] I'm doing it! And then I'm gonna come in there...and not buy anything. How's that sound?
Tell you what, how about we get together and save the rainforest?
Sure...be able to find your way out...when I'm done...throttlin' ya.

I'm talking about steel.
Yes, you were.
I'm talking about steel.
You were talking about it three times, just now.
Huh?

That's what you're talkin'.
Hey, man. Check it out, Jello-spine. I know that you're a pillow biter, grabber, okay? Butt pirate is what you're called. Now, that's no problem. I got no problem with that. That's your lifestyle, that's okay. But...you don't have to call up here trying to force your lifestyle on us hard-working individuals. Nobody wants to hear about your butt games, okay?
Especially with your skeleton meat that you've got.
Skeleton meat.
[music]
Yeah, yeah. I tell you what, take this skeleton bone and shove it right up your mom.
I don't eat shit like that!
You don't?
Neckbones? Hell no.
You put this bone in your mouth, you're saying?
That's what you're...all about, isn't it?
No, no. You're not putting nothing of mine in your mouth. I'm not like that. I just told you, you're not going to impose your lifestyle on me.
You're promoting some kind of neckbone, and I don't like it.
It melts in your mother. I mean, it melts in your mouth.
[laughing in background]
I want a refund.
You got it. Tell me sir, are you a r'tard?
That's not very friendly.
So, how long have you been gay? Westwood? West L.A.? Where is it the gay people are at? Your house?
I don't know. I want some catfish, bro.
I wanna talk to your mom. You know, we can make a movie, her and me. You can write out the title..."
My Mom Takes Stiff Black One
." No?
I want an orange soda.
Well, we have orange soda.
And a chocolate bar.
I have a chocolate bar.
Okay, I'll take it.
Where?
Pick-up.
You'll take it where? Where will you take it? Right up the wazoo, huh? Look man, I've had enough of your games, now.
[different music]
Why don't you go home and whack your willy a bit longer, tell your little girlfriend over there to help you. I hear him coughing in the background. What's he gagging on, your cat?
[music continues] Okay, you done?
Hey, wait, wait. I like that. Turn that up a little?
Could you...
Could you turn that up a little?
You done? I'm about out of time.
You're out of time?

Okay...uh, let's see...ah, what is it?
It's a Gorilla amp.

I use Gorilla Snot when I'm crackin' whips.
When you're crackin' whips?
You sound like you're talking through, ah...octaver pedal.

Triple turnaround time...let me ask you a question, dude...what kind of fuckin' drugs are you on?
Charlie, you sound like you're talking through a squeeze box or somethin'.
Well, regardless of what I'm talkin' through, what kind of drugs have you been doin', dude?
The only thing I know, is I got my hands all full of Gorilla Snot, and I'm on my way down there, and I'm gonna crack my frickin' whip.
You gonna crack a whip...and who're you gonna crack a whip on?
You're gonna...feel my grip.
I'm gonna see your ribs?
I'm gonna grap a hold of your lips!
Dude, I cannot fucking understand you.
It sounds like you're talkin' through a wah-wow pedal.
Well, I'm not.

Okay, well thanks Kirb. I don't really get into this computer shit. I'm very light weight. You know, I- I- I- I'm so behind the times. (It's fuckin' Saturday, right?) I barely know how to turn the thing on.
Look it. We need you to step away from the machine for the night, okay? Just... walk away.
I'm not anywhere near it. The computer's not anywhere near me. It's- it's in Bob DeLouise [?].
Well, don't touch it. You got me straight? Cause this-
Okay, Kirb. You got it. Let me know what's goin' on.
And we're gonna remove everything from inside. We're gonna replace everything.
What? You're gonna take out all my files? Don't lose anything, I don't think.
I'm gonna replace
everything
on there.
Okay.
Completely
factory reset. Just like the day you got it.
Alright, buddy boy. I love that.
So I hope you have everything, uh, backed up.
I think we do. I- I hope we do.
Good and just walk away now. I don't want ya... pokin' around.
Alright, Kirb. Thanks for the call.
I'm gonna be there at 6... a.m.
You comin' down here to the bus in Santa Cruz?
Yes I am. Need a cashier's check er... some method of payment at 6 a.m.
Yeah. Alright buddy-
We're gonna do a system wide scrub down of the
whole
system.
Okay but my computer's not here. You realize that? My computer's in Camarillo, California.
I don't want you going
anywhere
near the machine.
Well how can I do anything, Kirby? The computer's not here. It's down in Southern California. And I'm sure it's not on.
I'm gonna re-install every program that you've got. Factory reset.
I've gotta take this other call. Hold on.
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
Yeah, you got your machine unplugged over there?
My machine is- This is Eddie Money. You must be talking about doin' somethin' else, but somebody in the Eddie Money [?]. I don't have my computer here, Kirby. Maybe you doin' this for Joe Shaloop. I dunno.
Mmmmmmmmm.
My computer's not even here. My computer's down in Camarillo.
Well, have you got it unplugged?
I'm sure it's unplugged.
Have you got a check drawn?
No! I don't- I- I- I'm nowhere near- Kirby, I gotta take this other phone call! I'm getting ready to go the fuck on stage here! I gotta write a set list!
This is Kirby at Geek Squad, partner.
Kirby at Geek Squad. Hey, I hope this ain't a joke, Kirb- Kirby. But I never called you to fix my computer. I haven't been near my computer in three weeks.
I'm gonna delete everything I see.
Don't delete anything on my fucking computer, buddy! Keep your hands off my fuckin' computer!
Well, you called me. So you're soliciting us.
I never called you! I don't know who the fuck you are!
Kirby.
Kirby. I don't give a rat's ass who the fuck you are! Just keep your hands off my fuckin' computer!
[Laughing in background]
Don't go near it. That's all I can say. We've got your computer. That's end of story.
You don't have my fucking computer, so make some other prank phone calls with your computer bullshit and your- and your fucking crap. Just lay off, huh.
We just need a check and we'll release the machine.
Go stick your fucking tongue up your ass!
Or a credit card.
[Hang up]

...Entertainment, how can I help you?
You're trying to find a fortune teller?
You're looking for a fortune teller for a party, right?
Fortune teller? It's kind of an umbrella term that covers everything from tarot card reading, to palm reading...to handwriting analysis...to 'could you tell me where the spaghetti factory is?' You know, that sort of thing.
You're looking for a mummy? You're looking for a
mummy
Uh...what, a fortune teller dressed up as a mummy?
You're looking for two or three mummies off me?
That doesn't make sense, "two or three mummies."
[aside] He's talking about "two or three mummies"...
Or a juggler.
You're looking to find an agent for your juggling ability? I don't know what you're talking about.
Ch'yeah, I know!
Well, I guess...I guess we're gonna have a problem, then.
Ah, I don't...I don't like puppets. See, I got that fear...what'd they call that? It's some fear of puppets.
Yeah, he's...what's the puppet do to the juggler?
Ah, shit...I got two left thumbs. I can't even...juggle one!
Don't need a fortune teller, the puppet's gonna kill me, you said! So I know the outcome is...already taken care of!
Bring it on. I need that. 'Cause I'm a masochist.
Yeah, I'm a juggler.
It doesn't matter if you're a juggler, or...not a juggler, why are you calling the shop? Give me, give me...give me an answer, why are you calling here?
It doesn't matter!...I don't give a fuck.
This is the US Army recruiting station, how can I help you?
Yeah, uh, lookin' to enroll here.
Lookin' to enlist?
Yeah.
Hey, uh, sir, I-I think you called the other day. What I do is I set up an interview, ok? You come in, we determine your qualifications, I talk about the features and benefits of the program. If we have a match there, we got somethin' ya like and I find out you're qualified, then we talk next step.
Mm.
Honestly, I don't have enough time on the phone cuz, I'm-I'm in the middle of enlisting somebody right now.
Let me let you in on what I do which is perform in battle, so.
Ok.
I'm shaved, I'm ready...for battle, so.
Gotcha, gotcha. We still have to determine your qualifications, sir. Alright, listen I-I...I'd love to entertain you, sir, but I
really
hafta get goin', alright?
It's
really
a bad time for me, uh, lemme give you my, uh, email address...
Ok, go ahead.
Then we'll s-, then we'll see what, uh, what you can do, ok?
Ah, alright.
I'll g-I'll g-I'll give ya a little time to get prepared and...go ahead and grab a pen or something else.
Hopefully I'm worthy, sir. Go ahead.
What's your email address?
Uh, it's, uh, it's steven dot lee dot army dot mil.
I'm gonna send a picture of me
WHOOPIN' some ass.
Heh, alright.
So when you open it, best to turn the light up, light the room up bright, and take a real good look at it.
Roger, sir. Alright.
Cuz I am gonna grab holda
you
pretty quick.
Ok, that sounds good. I like a challenge. I love to fight. Matter of fact, they pay me to fight. Uh, what's your name?
My name's Enrique.
Enrique. Ok, gotcha.
I am gonna...get holda you and I'm gonna shake ya loose, fella.
Sounds good.
See if you can rise to my level.
Alright, well...Hopefully I'll be worthy, like I said. I got your number, Enrique. I'll give ya a call, alright? Gotta go.
I'm gonna get back to youuuu about five minutes from now.
This is the US Army recruiting station, how can I help you?
I wanna get physical.
I'm sorry, what's your name?
Enrique.
Enrique, huh? Alright, what's your-what's uh-what are you-what do you mean you wanna get physical?
On the battle-on the battlefield.
On what battlefield?
Uh, the Saharan battlefield.
The Saharan battlefield? There is no Saharan battlefield, man.
I want to enlist.
You wanna enlist? What do you wanna enlist to?
My fist.
Your fist? You wanna enlist to your fist? That doesn't make too much sense, Enrique.
Put me down on your
list
so I can get in there...get engaged in the battlefield, dude.
Get engaged in what battlefield?
I got discipline. Bud.
Well, I don't think you necessarily have discipline because I'm asking you simple questions, Enrique, and you're not giving me straight answers. What is it that you wanna do?
Are you a corporal, or?
Don't worry about who I am cuz I'm thinkin' you're just calling to, uh, mess around there, Enrique.
You can-you can bring your form up here and I'll fill it out, dude.
I don't think I wanna do that, Enrique, cuz I don't think you're actually being serious because you're not answering simple questions.
I'm ready to get physical with you right now outside.
Don't have any desire or need to, so...what are we really talkin' about there, Enrique?
It would be a lose-win, you-me. I wi-
Is that what it is?
I win.
You'd win?
End of paragraph.
You can go ahead and win all you want, Enrique, but what i-what is it you wanna do today? Why are-why are we talkin' on the phone?
I need to be placed on the battlefield.
I don't think we can do that, Enrique.
End of story.
Ha-
Right there.
Have you ever-have you ever been arrested?
Not in this country.
Have you-Not in this country? What country have you been arrested in-
Is that really relevant? Corporal?
It-it
is
very relevant. Why are-what country have you been arrested in, Enrique?
The Netherlands.
In the Netherlands? What were you arrested for, Enrique?
There was a l...lot of nude people there.
Mm, so why were you particularly arrested for nudity, Enrique? So you were being indecent in public? Indecent nudity? [Because I'm bored.]
You're gonna be...indecent for, uh, presentation when I'm through with ya.
Is that right? M'kay. I'll guess I'll be indecent then. So-
Grab hold-
Let me ask you, uh-
Grab holda your neck.
Have you graduated high school?
Grab holda your neck.
Have you graduated high school, there, Enrique?
I got...an equivalency.
A GED? GEDs are not qualified at this time, Enrique. Have you ever had any surgery?
Not true.
Have you ever had any surgery?
Oral surgery.
Yeah? What type?
Oral.
What. Type.
Mouth surgery.
What type of mouth surgery?
Lip...surgery.
Lip? What did you have done to your lip, Enrique?
Reconstructive.
For what, Enrique?
...Fist.
You got punched? How did you-how did you get your busted lip, Enrique?
Lips. Two lips. I got two fists for two lips.
You self-inflicted a wound?
I'm gonna punch your lip. I'm gonna tear the-
Did you self-inflict a wound?
[tribal drum beat starts]
How did you hurt your lip, Enrique?
In the jungles of...Namamutu.
Have you ever been seen by a mental health professional, Enrique?
Not in this...nation.
What have you been seen for mental health for, Enrique?
[beat stops]
What are you getting at?
What have you been seen for mental health, Enrique?
I was nude the one time, dude.
Ahem. And did they prescribe you any medication?
Yes.
And when's the last time you stopped taking that medication, Enrique?
Oh, I'm on it.
Well, if you're currently on medication, Enrique, that's also a disqualifier.
[sample from "
Eddie Money
" plays:]
You guys are so goddamn fuckin' unprofessional! I can't believe it. So, go fuck yourself!
Alright, unfortunately you are disqualified-
[another sample:]
Well
, y
ou know what? I-I never ordered that.
At this time for the military.

God bless you abundantly.
Hi, this is Gavinaugh. How're you doing?
Gavinaugh? Okay.
I wanted to, uh, find a singer.
Okay.
[low hum]
And I was hoping to get a little bit of an audition. Do you take PayPal for payment?
PayPal for payment? Umm...no.
Could I-could I read a credit card, or...umm, I just need a little bit of an audition, and, ah... I can send you a deposit. [music plays quietly]
[singing]
God bless you abundantly! Leave a message, thank you.
That was great. Singing's great. [low hum]
What is it that you needed sung?
I wanted to know if you could do
inverse
singing, if you could sing
backwards
Singing backwards? No, I don't. I don't sing backwards. It doesn't sound like something that I would be appropriate for.
Do you do songs of worship, or?
My particular specialty is singing hymns and sacred music.
The other thing I'm producing is more straightforward vocally, but it is
far
more demonic. Is that something you might be interested in?
It's
wha-wha
-I'm sorry, what? Did you say demonic?
Yes.
No, I-I'm not-I don't do demonic. God bless you, dear heart.
So you couldn't do any growling, or?
No, I don't do that. I'm not-I'm not into demonic. I'm-I'm for Jesus. Jesus is lord of all.
Do you do any screaming, at all?
[laughs] I already answered your question, dear heart.
Wh-
So God bless you. God-God bless you. Bye for now. God bless you.
I Love Video.
What the hell.
Who...is this?
Sheppler. Now... I'd like to find Exploratory Romp, for rental.
What is it? Exploratory...Romp?
But I mean, you're talking 2 to 4 to 6 days, for rental, right?
For exploring what? Romping?
You and me, get together and romp around a little.
Heh...romping...ah...blowin' my mind, dude. Umm...in like 2 to 4, 6 days?
It'll be a tour de force of...
Oh, a tour de force.
I have...
You're not looking for a movie?
I want to rent it...today!
What is it? Exploratory Romp?
I'm gonna romp around and up and down over there. How's that sound? Got my hiking boots on, man. Kick 'em around a little bit.
Nah, I don't think so.
Don't think so, huh?
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
You're gonna see double, after I'm done pummelin' ya.
Nah.
I'm gonna bring a tour de force of martial arts in there.
You know, we've got a lot of movies here. You have to be careful about knocking over the displays. Collectibles, too, like...if you end up breaking something, man...lots of money. Better bring money, too. You know who you're talking to?
This is Vulcan Video, right?
No.
Oh, it's not? Sorry.
It's not.
You guys are fine. Don't worry, I'm not really mad.
You're not mad?
I thought you were Vulcan Video, so...you're safe. You get a pass. 'Cause I was gonna
WHOOP y'ass
Well, you might be able to whoop someone at Vulcan, but I don't think you could handle, ah...you could handle this guy.
You're just lookin' to get hurt!
If you come in here trying to throw punches, I think that you'll be very surprised.
I've got boxing gloves on my neck right now, on a rope.
Yeah, yeah..you can put on those boxing gloves, but you'll be knocked out before you even throw the first punch.
I'll go left, middle, right, middle-right, left, middle, to your face.
That's more than..you're going to be able to get off before you're knocked out, man. Sorry. You're not gonna get that left out. You know, that first left is going to be...knocked out...you're knocked out.
Gonna be lights out, when I'm done with ya.
Is there anything I can help you with, dude? 'Cause I've got real customers.
I'm gonna wipe you out with martial arts. Period. End of discussion.
Bring some money, we'll put some money on it.
You come marchin' down MY street with my attitude...I'm gonna be out there.
Listen man, you called here. Now, I've got caller ID.
Oh, no.
And it is now illegal to make...prank phone calls.
Please don't turn me in.
Unless you have business with us, I'm gonna go ahead and, ah...let you go, here. If you come in here trying to throw punches, you'll be knocked out, man. I mean, there's no way to fight me over the phone. So, get your pussy ass down here, and...bring it.
I'll bring my right, middle, left, left...middle, left...
It's not really that impressive over the phone, man.
My fists are moving right now: up, left...left, middle, up.
No. You're knocked out. Bring it.
I'm gonna bring you down.
Alright, Shepard.
And I'm gonna
kick y'ass
You keep saying that. It's all in your imagination.
It's gonna be all on the sidewalk.
Bring it.
I Love Video.
I Love Video? I wanted to subscribe, sir.
You want to subscribe?
To, ah..
I mean, we have memberships.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, you know? Just get off my back.
Yeah.
But, ah...yeah, let's get it started.
Well, you need to come in with a debit/credit card and ID.
Mmm...you can maybe you can meet me halfway, how about?
Yeah. And you can kiss my ass, how about that?

Yeah Mike I had my car hijacked here uh I'm up here I'm on my way to the hospital there's been a lot of police here, all my belongings are gone, they caught two of the kids two. They haven't gotten my truck yet. We were chasing them in another carr uh it's been pretty wild it started at about 10 to 12. I left here with Vic, went to boyers came back and uh I heard my carr start and that was the start of this whole thing and I wish there was some communication between you and us but I... it's tough I got your message uh we've been out there were about 35 squad carrs all around here and. etc. etc. and I guess he didn't collect any checks, I'm not sure. Just got back from the sub from the sub uh one of the police things. So I, I thought you'd be back so I could get a ride back to my motel room. My truck has been stolen there is no longer a truck with everything inside it all the businees shit everything. All my glasses, all my personal posessions, drivers license, etc. etc. And I guess they caught two or three of'em, they're one of'ems in jail on a felony charge. They didn't get the driver of the carr, we chased them to 58th and washington there was another guy here that started chasing 'em I jumped in his carr uh my head hit the ceiling and I can't move so I might be going to the hospital and uh I'll talk to you later on goodbye.
"Who is this? Who is that?"
And I go, "Please don't ever call here again." I said, "If you've got a problem, you can drive here and talk to me about it."
"Who are you?"
I said, "I'm the owner." "
Well, you fuckin' son-"
and-and
she started swearin' and then hung up. Hey, I don't
need
this in my life. In my business here, I just don't. So I don't know how to stop these people. If worse comes to worse, we'll call the police.
"Hello, who is this, god dammit!"
I said, "Well, who is
this?"
"My name is Mr. Blah-blah-blah, and-and
don't you forget that."
I go, "Oh." I go, "Well, well, what-" I go, "Don't call here again, please. You're-you're creating-" God
dammit.
He goes, "Rah-rah-rah-rah." He goes, "You're a
coward,
you sonofab-" and started saying all kinds of things and-and then he hangs up. It's too weird. We're a
business
here. I can't imagine other businesses having stuff like this happen. It's
too
fuckin' weird. If we get a weird signal here, we can't talk to 'em anymore. Hey, we didn't
really knooow,
but uh, if you wanna call the police and then you spend your time in court, goin' and doin' it, you can do it. I don't have
time
anymore. And you can get a microphone and-and play the game and do it all. It takes a hour. How do we
stop
this? If they keep it up, we're gonna have to tape record a few of these callings and at least, uh, have ah, ah somebody call 'em and say, "If you do it again, you're gonna, you know, there'll be harassment charges." Yeah, I - every time I pick up now, I don't know who I'm gonna - you know, if it's gonna be some weird thing or something.
Miller Time
is an album by Longmont Potion Castle.
Miller Time
was included in the 2014 release
Ultimate Session Bundle
described as a previously unreleased album from 2000, though official CD-R copies have been spotted at Amoeba Music in Hollywood, CA as early as 2013.
Miller Time
consists of a series of telephone conversations and answering machine messages that paint a picture of the dysfunctional life of LPC's former employer Ralph Miller. Accusations of stalking abound, along with talk of restraining orders, "disposition trials", "afadavids" as well as some distinctly Coloradoan threats of physical violence that should be instantly familiar to fans of LPC.
LPC can be heard briefly on some of the tracks but
Miller Time
does not feature any prank phone calls
per se
and is a very different animal from the other LPC albums.

A package of lambs from Lebanon?
I don't think I ordered anything from Lebanon.
What are they? Lambs?
(Laughs) Uh, well, you're not gonna deliver it here.
Sounds like a harassment call to me.
I think I'm gonna call the police. I mean this sounds like trouble to me.
Incomplete transcription. Audio from approximately 0:20 - 2:45 has not yet been transcribed.
Ahh (laughs) you won't be delivering any lambs to us, darling. We're a research and development company.
Maybe you should do your research before you try to deliver us lambs.
He's having a laugh, because we wouldn't ever take live animals here.
(laughs) who is this?
Ewan Rump, ok. (laughs)
Ok Ewan Rump, who put you up to this?
Your manager, Gregory Nipper. (laughs)
Well your manager's a joker.
These poor lambs must be very tired by now.
Oh my goodness, that is a big old parcel. Are they wrapped up?
Oh, poor little lamby.
I wish I knew who you were Ewan Rump. Mr. Rump's got a hump!
Well, I've got to go, 'cause I've got a meeting.
Alright then, well have fun with the lamby. Buh-bye.
I don't know anything about a Lebanese Lamb Center.
I do, I don't know what you're talking about.
We don't order anything from Lebanon.
You're not gonna see any checkbook when you walk in here.
Back on up.
Get on the phone, you're gonna want to hear this.
Go...Alright, my business partner's on the phone with me.
We didn't order lamb from you.
No, we didn't.
You can, you can come here, and nobody's gonna pay for anything, because this is not our problem.
No it's not. Yeah, it's not.
The lambs are from the country Lebanon?
Yeah, and they're live.
To our butcher shop, here in Nashville?
I, I guarantee that's not gonna be the case.
No it's not, it's not.
If you bring live lamb to my butcher shop, I will have the cops here in about two minutes.
Or we can just have them come on over here, so that way they're here in 20 minutes whenever you arrive, so that we can make sure there's no issue.
We don't, we don't slaughter animals here.
(sigh) What's the attitude about, sir?
(laughs)
What do you have there for us?
Lamb, like sheep? Like baaaaaah?
You have them alive?
Oh yeah.
I, I think that you like to pull my leg here. And if you call me from UPS that you have four sheeps somewhere sitting there, and you'd like to deliver them to me, and I have to write you a check for eighteen-hundred dollars...
I'm not even allowed to butcher them here. Do you understand that?
I call the police down here? Because you monkeying around with me.
You try to pull my leg, because this is a lamb scam.

It just takes place at the top of the hour. It lasts about one hour.
Umm, I mean, our ice cream is in a cooler, but what I'm saying is we have thousands of dollars of product. If you turn it up to 110 degrees, you're gonna melt our product.
And we're gonna turn your freezer off. Okay?
You're gonna turn our freezer off? Uhh, ok. What's the number that I can deny this at?
Oh, there's nothing to deny, young man.
Ok, well I'll have to call and figure out if they wanna do it, so...
Oh, I've made the call.
You've made the call? Uh, no matter what?
No matter what. You know, we've got the power here.

You should make yourself clear!
We're gonna be heating ya up this afternoon, ok, just for 45 minutes.
No! Not goin' heat nothin' up to 110 degrees.
What do you mean "no"?
Just what I said. Who-who are you? You call up on the telephone...I don't know who you are, I don't know what's going on, but you ain't heatin' up nothing to a 110 degrees.
Sir, I want you to stand by for the heat increase, all right?

We turn it back down.
Uhh, we've never had this before.
Okay, then we do need a credit card number. It's a one-time fee, it's 65 dollars.
Why?
For non-compliance.
This is a hoax. Nah, I don't-I don't-I don't agree. You're not clarifying yourself. This-this is just a crank, you know. If you're not the company, stop calling people like that.
Do you even know that there's a new pope?
No, I don't... nah... you know what? Nevermind.
Hi, this Doug.
Aw yeh. This is Detroit Energy. We're going to be doing out annual heater checks and we're gonna be bumping up your temperature today to about 110 degrees. Just wanted to notify ya.
What do you want me to do?
It's automated, sir. You don't have to do anything. We do it here at the plant.
Well, what are you calling me for?
I just want you to stand by here, and we're gonna increase the heat up to 110 and just let us know when you feel the temperature rise, all right?
Well, who are you calling? I'm not even a customer.
Well, we're the parent company, sir.
I don't care. Do whatever you want.
Okay, if you don't want to participate, then it is a one-time fee of 65 dollars.
Go fuck yourself, asshole, and don't call me back on this number anymore, you crank caller. Kay? I'm gonna turn your number into the Do Not Call list.
Nah, this here is non-compliance.
Don't call me back anymore, you scam artist.

And I have cash on the barrel.
Ok, first of all, what store are you calling?
Uh, Depp's.
Okay, you're calling Depp's. Okay. Did you talk to a certain person about a special order?
I have to use the restroom as well. So far you've given me a big goose egg.
First of all, you gave me a big goose egg on whatever your information is. Why don't you just come on in and we'll help you when you get here, okay?
Right now, I am on the freeway.
Well, you know what? You do a detour if you really want this stuff that day. You come into our store and we'll be more than glad to help ya'. How's that?
What part are you not understanding?
What part are

Aw, c'mon-on-on-on.
We don't sell kegs, number one. Number two, I don't know who the hell you are, what the hell you want, and second of all, I don't know who took your order, okay? And there's an echo so I can't understand a damn word of what you're saying.

There is no Manny that works here!
Mayonnaise, I call him for short. He loves it!
Well apparently, I don't know who you're talking about. We have no Mayonnaise, We have no Manny, we have nobody who works here by that name.
It goes over like gangbusters, I'm telling you.
And we don't do damn kegs of beer.

Is this a pawn store? What is this place? What's the name of this place here?
The Happy Hucker.
Okay. You wanna look at my cannon?
You're going from like slow motion to fast motion to slow motion to fast motion. I can't understand you.
I've got a battle cannon. You're not gonna-
Battle-
-believe your eyes when you see this thing. It's out of this world. You got another thing coming. You know, this thing is immense.
I don't know what's going on with this connection .... it sounds like this you talk like this [Talking in a slowed down voice] and [High-pitched noise]..... Slow and then it's fast and I can't understand you.
What about a 19 foot long taxidermied alligator?
Like... you said you have an alligator and a cannon? I can't help you with either of those things.
Well I am in a hot air balloon. I am landing, but I have the merchandise...
Well everything you said so far I can't help you with.
I'm from Alamogordo. Can't ya help me out er....... What do you think? I can't tell...
No, sir. Not with those items.
And wh- And what's this you're talking about? Moving in fast motion? I mean, once we meet, we can move forward, if that's what you mean.
It's- it's your voice. It's going from like slow-motion to fast-motion to slow-motion to fast-motion. I can't understand. It sounds like you're on a recording. Like it's... All I've- All I've heard so far is an alligator and a cannon and I- I- I couldn't with that, sir-
The whole thing is so heavy and it's slicker 'n snot, is what it is.
Sir, you're not-
Slicker 'n snot is what it is.
I- I- I can't help you with that.
I hear ya.
Afternoon. Central City.
Oooooooooooh yeeeeeeeeaaaaaah.
I needed about a hundred limes if you could sell 'em to me. I'm up in Mason City.
Um... You're in Mason City and you want limes from me? You realize you're calling a liquor store in Des Moines?
What can you do for me today,sir? This is Brian from Mason City.
Brian, go to the grocery store. You can get a hundred limes there.
I'm in my car and I'm on my way right by ya.
I don't have two hundred limes.
One hundred.
I don't have one hundred limes.
Instead of sittin' here on the phone, why don't ya box 'em up and I'll come pick 'em up.
Why don't ya pick 'em up on your way up the street, then. 'Cause you're gonna wipe me outta limes, and I don't even know who you are.
My friend referred me to you. The grocery store is plum out. He said that you could hook me up. My friend Leland.
I don't know any Lelands. I don't deal with anybody in Mason City. The problem is, if I give you a hundred limes, then I'm out of a hundred limes. If the grocery stores are out of a hundred limes, then obviously all my normal intown customers don't have any limes. I'm sorry, my man.
I'll pay-
But you're gonna have to somewhere else to find some limes.
I'll pay double, triple what you're asking.
I don't care. Because my regular customers who I deal with every single day won't get any limes.
My money's just as good as anybody else's.
Not arguing with that my man. It's a very simple answer. I don't have a hundred for you.
I- I-
Call somebody else or go to the grocer store.
I'm gonna cut you a check. It's gonna be fine.
I'm sorry bud.
Hey bud, listen up!
Okay, chief. You call me again, I'm gonna call the cops.

Advanced Hydro.
Yes, I'm trying to make a laser oil compound outdoors, and I'm trying to keep out an opossum.
Laser oil? I, I, I'm not familiar with that. I just googled "laser oil" I'm interest...interesting. Now, wha, what do you need on my end?
Why don't you try listening up here, a little bit.
I'm not familiar with what your laser oil is, frankly you're kind of rude. Wha, what are you looking for, dude?
I need to get a fence set up to keep this opossum out of my affairs.
A fence? Well I don't set up fences dude. I'm an indoor hydroponics store, dude, I'm a grow shop. Like I sell growing equipment. Ballasts, bulbs, lights...
How about I come in there and knock you around a little bit?
Am I really getting a phone call from someone asking about laser oil, and then threatening to beat me up? This is a business, you're threatening me. I mean there's two ways of doing things, but I'll basically just call the cops right now. So, if you want to do that, go ahead and come on down. Okay bro, but I have to go, I'm trying to help a customer and I, I, I have a certain reputation. So I, I don't know what laser oil is, and I don't know what your problem is, but don't be disrespecting me.
I'm gonna need store credit, I figure. Because, while we're talking here, this opossum has just wiped me out.
I don't understand what an opossum is. I, I, I don't have store credit.
Well you can just let me take what I neeeed.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna report you for calling and threatening me multiple times. So I'm gonna get off the phone right now and call the police. Bye.

Third Avenue Signs, Rick Speaking.
Hi, I need to get some...magnetic oil.
Magnetic oil? We don't have anything like that.
Well, I'm shooting lasers, and I need to cordon it off with magnetic oil.
Uhhh, I think you might have phoned the wrong number, we're a sign shop.
Well, you have magnets, don't you?
Yeah, how much do ya need?
Well, I've got forty-two-hundred lasers firing right here, fella.
Well, I don't know anything about your company, to tell you the truth. So, you know, I've got a little bit of magnetic material here, if you need more, I can order some in, but...
How 'bout if I start firing lasers up 'ere?
I don't know what you're looking for, ya know? I sell magnetic sheeting, yes, if you'd like some of that I can sell you that, but I don't sell magnetic oil. You know, if you'd explain what you'd like, it'd be a lot easier for me to decide if I have it or not.
I wanna drape giant sheets of magnets over my lasers.
Well, then you'd probably be better off to phone a magnetic wholesaler.
A sailor? I don't have time to...
...WHOLEsaler.
I'm not talking about oysters here fella, I'm talking about lasers. You with me?
I understand what'cha need, but you know the difference between wholesale and retail?
Are you a marine biologist, or what are ya?
What is your problem man?
Look, I'm firing lasers here, and I don't have time to go down to the dock, or whatever it is you're suggesting, OK?
Do you know what a wholesaler is? It's a company that sells to retail shops. I buy magnetic from a magnetic WHOLEsaler, it's got nothing to do with ships or fish or oceans.
what part don't ya...
Is this some kind of joke phone call, or what?
Why don't ya run up here and gimme what I neeeeeed.
I don't know whatcha neeeeeeeeeeed.
I'm firin' lasers every which way up here.
I don't really care.
Your sign says magnetics, fella!
It says magnetics, yes, it's a sheeting of magnetic. It's got nothing to do with oil.
You're runnin' me around here.
I think you should call someone else (unintelligible), good bye.
(Ring)
Kelvins Wheel, Chad here.
Yeah, I got a twenty-four wheeler here. I need some chrome work done on it.
What do you want to get done?
I need it polished up, and I need all the wheels inflated. And then deflated, and inflated all over again.
(Laughs) When can you bring it to me? I’ve got room for you tomorrow morning at about three-thirty in the AM.
Why don’t you head up ‘ere and gimme what I need? Okay?
(Laughs) Done! (Laughs) I can do it!
What am I looking at here on time and money?
(Laughs) Sixty-three-hundred bucks, and about forty-five minutes.
I’ll look for ya.
(Laughs) I’ll be the guy running down the street with an air compressor, one of those mobile ones. (Laughs)
You’re gonna be running the other way when I’m done with you.
(Laughter) (unintelligible, perhaps “aw shit, he’s making me run”)
(Ring)
This is Trish's Dishes.
Uh, this is Gopher Bone calling.
Google Phone? Wow, I can't understand you.
I'm Gopher Bone.
You are what? I can't understand you.
Are you deaf?
I'm not deaf. I don't really know what, how to spell it. Wh, what the words are coming out of your mouth, I don't know what you're saying, right. Why don't you spell it to me? What is it anyway?
Why don't you switch ears?
Why don't you speak clearer?
Are both your ears as bad as this one? 'Cause...
You only got one mouth, and you're not talking really clearly.
I'm Gopher Bone.
See, I don't understand you.
What are you, dumb?
I'm not as dumb as you.
I'm looking for The Big Beaver.
We don't have no Big Beaver. I don't know what you're talking about.
(Ring)
May Hut (?)
Yeah, this is, uh, Hot Frog. And I’m looking for, uh, The Big Beaver up ‘ere.
The Hot Frog looking for The Big Beaver? (Laughs) Are ya?
Gopher Bone sent me up ‘ere.
(Laughs) Gopher Bone, huh? Sounds like a good time.
I need to get some snares set up.
You need to get some snares, se, se, ugh, set up?
And I’m fixin’ to shut you up.
Sweet. Sounds like a good plan.
(Ring)
Barking Bitches. (Dog barks in background)
Do you have The Big Beaver? I’d like to get…
The Big Beaver?
I’d like to get a bottle of it.
We don’t have The Beaver.
(Note: Audio Juggling starts here)
(New voice, liquor store employee?) The Big Beaver? Ahh, let me see if it’s in my system.
(Barking Bitches voice) (Dog barks) If it’s not in my system, we don’t have it.
(Ring) (Liquor Store) I don’t have anything in my system yet. (ring)
(LPC) I’m not suggesting you’ve drank it.
(Liquor Store) No, it’s not in my system. As far as I know, I don’t know where to order it from.
(Chuck) This is Chuck, may I help you?
(Liquor store) Have you seen it in Dallas before?
(Chuck) Hello?
(Liquor store) Have you seen it in Dallas before?
(Chuck) What is it you’re looking for?
(Liquor store) Oh, somebody was asking me if, uhhh, we had any Big Beaver liqueur or aperitif.
(Chuck) Big Beaver?
(Liquor store) Yeah.
(Chuck) I have never seen it.
(Liquor store) I hadn’t seen it, and it’s not in my system.
(New voice) I mean, I got a chick that has a big beaver down the street. (Laughs) But, I haven’t heard of that one. A lot of the stuff comes out first in New York, we have to find out what it is. Wha, what’s the flavor of it.
(New male voice) Hello?
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Hello?
(Male voice) Uh, hello?
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Hi.
(Male voice) I don’t know how...I don’t know how I got connected to you.
(Susan’s Fine Wine) I’m sorry, what’s going on here? We’ve got multiple phone calls going on at the same time.
(LPC) Do you have The Big Beaver?
(Susan’s Fine Wine) I have never heard of it.
(LPC) Well, uh, it’s pretty new. Pretty dang new. (ring). You know, I just saw an infomercial on it.
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Are you on a cell phone? I think you need to hang up because there’s another phone ringing.
(Liquor Barn employee) Yeah? Liquor Barn?
(Susan’s Fine Wine) You’re calling two liquor stores at the same time. You know what, sir, that’s looking for The Big Beaver, you’re speaking to Susan’s Fine Wine and also to The Liquor Barn. So you need to hang up, and just make one single phone call.
(LPC) Work with me.
(Susan’s Fine Wine) I’m trying to.
(New male voice) Hello?
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Hello? (sigh) Okay, this guy’s called to a couple different liquor stores and he needs to hang up, so we can all get disconnected.
(Male voice) Interesting, okay, well I will hang up then.
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Uh, I’ve tried hanging up, but he still has the line open.
(Male voice) Good lord. (sigh) Great. Okay.
(Susan’s Fine Wine) Okay?
(End of track)

(Unintelligible - probably a person's last name - "Pivet's"?)
Yeah, this is Duncan...Cocker. You're neighbor.
Yeah! Hi.
Yeah, you guys were making a whole lotta noise in there last night. Didn't appreciate it.
(Laughs) Yeah, well I'm focused on these crazy animals.
So I need to know that you're gonna keep things down tonight, volume wise. Ya got me?
Uhh, ok. We'll turn the TV down and, uh, keep the dogs quiet. All that sort of stuff.
Yeah, you better do everything you can.
We'll keep an eye on it. Or an ear on it.
Pipe down, do it now...
Ok.
...And I don't want to hear from you again.
Fair enough.

(ring)
(LPC in strange voice) Well, hello?
Who have I got.
I'm Duncan Whopper.
Ok.
I live near by ya, and you guys are making way too much noise at night, you know that?
Are we? Well I'll tell you, we'll have to curb it then, won't we.
Why don't cha bring 'er down a couple notched here tonight? I got a big meeting tommorra.
(Laughs) And how's the rest of your day going?
I don't even know if I'm comin' or goin' lady. I didn't get any sleep last night.
(Laughs) Well, as I said, we'll do our best to curb it.
(Ring)
Hey, is Evelyn there?
Yeah.
This is Duncan Cocker.
Duncan? Crocker? Who are you?
Your neighbor. Last night I was hearing dogs and cats and birds and everything over at your house.
And what time was this?
It was too late, if you ask me. I was trying to get some rest.
You need to answer my question. What time was this?
I had a big, big meeting this morning.
Our dogs are in bed at nine thirty P.M.
That's the most cockamamie thing I've ever heard.
Who are you? What address are you?
Duncan Cocker. I'm catty corner to you, one house down.
DUNCAN, WHAT'S YOUR FUCKING ADDRESS?!!!?
Why don't you shut down your zoo over there and keep it quiet?
Our dogs are in bed. You're talking to the wrong person.
(ring)
Yes?
Hey, this is Hooper. I'm your neighbor. And you guys had way too much noise and commotion last night up at your place.
No, you've got the wrong number, my god.
Oh, I heard dogs barkin', and televisions blarin', and everything else.
IT'S NOT ME. I put my dogs to bed at four o'clock. Where do you live?
In the lavender house.
Where in the hell is the lavender house?
I ain't fixin' to go nowhere, so why don't you keep it down to a dull roar, so I can get some rest here?
IT'S NOT MY DOGS, IT'S THE HOUSE NEXT TO ME.
Don't try to pull the old switcheroo on me, lady.
WELL YOU CRAZY BASTARD, IT'S NOT ME. IT'S NOT MY HOUSE. WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER?!?
My phone number?
NOOO! The number of your house...
I'm in the lavender house.
...the one where you get your mail.
Now, why don't you keep it down to a dull roar? I had a meeting this morning and I missed it 'cause of all your commotion there.
It's not MEEE! My god! I'm...Call the damn police!
(Ring)
Hello?
My name's FiFi NoNo. I'm your neighbor. And I've been hearing way, way, way too much noise coming out of your place last night and the night before.
I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't know any such neighbor. I have no idea what you're talking about...whatsoever.
It sounded like you were on my roof...So I need you to pipe down, so I can get some r...
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL YOU ARE! Look mister, I can't be your neighbor, I don't live in your area code. I live in the area code 303. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
So do I. It was a Herculean effort just to get through the night, it was so noisy over at your place.
I haven't got my stereo on. I haven't had my stereo on for weeks.
Friggin', it was like you were on my roof last night.
My neighbor on one side is named Chuck. The neighbor on the other side of me is named Bob. I don't even know who you are.
I don't give a good dog gone who it is.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN EITHER, BUT IT'S NOT ME! Stop calling me, and stop annoying me...
Listen to me...
...I don't know what you're talking about. I am not...What did you hear? Did you hear music? What did you hear?
Oh, I heard televisions blaring, I heard birds chirping, I heard everything I could hear. Are you telling me you don't have a television and a bird? 'Cause I heard 'em all night long.
I have two cats, and I have a television set.
Yeah, I know you do, 'cause I heard it all night.
I wasn't up all night. I went to bed at about 12:30 last night.
That's cockamamie.
And I didn't hear a damn thing!
It sounded like you were blowing into a saxophone all night long. It was outrageous.
It's not me!
I don't believe you. I got your number from the postmaster, and he knows what he's doing. Believe me he's worked there for 10 years.
Wha, wha, what address did you give him?
Listen, I need twenty-five dollars, to get a hotel room.
I don't give a damn, it's not me. It is not me, and if you don't stop calling me, and don't stop harassing me, I'll contact the police.
Oooohhh.

Hm, ha... (echo)
Hi, it's a great day at the (inaudible) Boarding School, how may I direct your call?
Yeah... (echo persists) I'm surprised that yer... phone number isn't on your website, I'm real surprised. It just says the letters... LARS.
Excuse me... a second, who are you trying to reach sir?
School of Music.
Ah... okay. And this is... the registration office for the School of Performing Arts, and you're looking for what
exactly
I... wanted to enroll, I mean you can
appreciate
that right?
Ah... ab-solutely, that's what we do...
(drumbeat in background)
I mean what do you think so
far
, just here, listen...
(drumbeat continues)
Hmhmhm... I do realize that sir, I think that ahhhhm... I'm not able to help you in that way, I think...it's an open enrollment school...
...Do I
qualify
Heheh, that's not how it works sir.
Well how
does
it work?
I recommend you go to the website...
Is financing, is financing available?
Ahh, no, sorry. I can hear that you're playing a mix that you've created and I'm
so
sorry, that's not the way we work in the registration office, but I wish you best of luck.
Yeah, and can I get a forebearance on the, um... dues that I already owe? Is that somethin' you can issue, or...
N...no! Heheh...
(recorded voice plays in fast-forward)
Hello? ... OK, let me talk, OK. This is the Music
Department
. If you're interested in anything else you probably should contact the university extension...
Can I, can you
fax
me the information about the (inaudible)...
I can't do anything for you sir, you need to call them directly.
OK, well can I
just
stop by.
I... you can stop by but it won't do you any good.
I'm satisfied with that.
I can't hear you, I
can't hear you
, sir. Bye bye.
What's the matter.
[Answering machine message]
Hello, this is Officer Albino from
LAPD Pacific Division
. And we received a phone call from someone, um, to our front desk and they said someone from this number uh... has been calling them and um... has been making threatening remarks towards them. And they said their name was Fifi. If uh... you could stop doing that, that'd be great. Um... if you have any questions, give us a call at our front desk.
[Hang up]
... Hollywood (inaudible) Services, how may I help you?
Hi... Yeah, this is Nuno...
How can I help you, sir.
Yeah, I uhhh... had some trouble with a spindle... ticket... to the movie... and y'all wouldn't accept it up there, so I'm lookin' to get a refund.
Which movie, sir.
I'm lookin' to get quadruple the purchase price, I figure that ought'a cover it.
For what movie, sir, 'cause we don't issue refunds, first of all.
My printer was spittin' the thing out when I printed my ticket, and the lady up front wouldn't take it, so I snuck in. Y'know, I'm an honest man. But if yer tellin' me yer not gonna give me my money back then...
... I don't understand what you're talking about, sir, were you here today or what?
I'm here now!
Where are you at then? (inaudible)
I'm in the movie theatre, but I don't...
... In the movie theatre talking on your phone.
I don't like what I'm seein' in here... and if you all can't uh... accept my printer as-is, I'm not givin' you a dime.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I want quadruple my money back.
What, what printer? I don't understand sir what you're talking about.
I...
You're not supposed to be on your phone if you're actually in our theatre.
Well I'm... keepin' my voice down, so you'll have to listen up, OK? But I want quadruple my money back, period, end of discussion.
You're not gonna get anything sir, 'cause I don't know what you're talking about. What is your issue?
The purchase price of the ticket.
What
purchase price? We're $15.50 on the weekends.
Yeah, times four, is...
Times four for what reason?
... is $64, and that's what I need here today.
For what reason sir, you're not givin' me any reason why you're talkin' to me if you're in the movie theatre.
Y'all wouldn't accept my ticket, I paid for it.
What
ticket? Tell me what you're talkin' about.
I printed out a ticket for the movie.
OK,
what
movie?
...and then I show up there and they say it's too wrinkled.
What movie was it for?
I'm in the theatre right now, theatre six.
And where are you
supposed
to be?
Come in here and sit down and work this out or I'm not payin' you at all, friend.
I'm gonna hang up sir, 'cause you're not even supposed to be talkin' to me.
Well what do you want me to do. My printer just prints the way it does, I can't do anything about it!
OK, what, what is the reasoning, we didn't let you in with what you gave us, I don't understand, I'm missing a picture of what you're trying to...
She didn't like the look of my ticket.
Who, the ticket person?
Yeah.
Did it not have a barcode...
There was this Indian guy jumpin' around... all sorts of things were happenin' up there.
Do... you're watchin'
The Losers
, is that what you're tellin' me?
Yeah, you readin' my mail on this one, gal, or what?
... (inaudible) I'm tryin' to understand what you're tryin' to tell me.
I snuck in! OK, I'm an honest man, what do you want from me?
So you had tickets for the five o'clock show, is that what you're tellin' me?
Correct! And I want you to quadruple my money back, period, end of paragraph.
Why?
Anguish, punitive damages, and other reasoning.
Sorry, I'm hanging up.
I'm not gonna tolerate it.
NOTE: LPC's voice appears only seldomly on this track where indicated. This seems like clips from many different calls, separated by tape rewinding sounds.
Hallo, what can I do for you sir?
(Unintelligible) I don't give a damn. You try.
(LPC) Ah, how'd you like it if i put my boot in your face?
(Laughs) Well you could try probably.
(LPC) You're gonna give me eighty-nine ninety-three.
I'm gonna give you shit.
Maaan, you know what? This is rude. He's such a fucking jackass. (Laughs). Stupid ignorant white bastard.
Yo what up? This your boy Ace up here in (city name?) Oklahoma. I was wanting to know if I could come down to record twenty-five songs? I want to get a hip hop shit. I wanna be that shit. I'm on that 2Pac, muthafuckin Biggie, fuckin' thug shit, like SPM and motherfucking shit like oxycontin (unintelligible) and shit homie. All that good shit. Fucking call me back.
Ok, I'm not just a regular person that just wants to be in a band and be popular, and make money, and all the jive ass reasons most people put out records. I'm dying to communicate things to people. 'Cause I, uh, when I was growing up a lot of things that I wanted to express were just shut out. Annnd, I never got along very well with my father, and he constantly castrated and invalidated anything. And I think a lot of, uh, overly authoritarian behavior is wrong. But I also support independence and freedom, and not infringing upon the rights of others. And, uh, you call yourself Dormant Utopia, ok, well (laughs) if everybody, uh, acted upon that premise, I think you'd be living a utopia.
Hi, this is Cindy with Westword newspaper. I need to deliver a "Best of Denver" plaque for DU Records, and I need an address. If you could please call me back, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
Well, I don't give a damn what you come for, but I'm not paying for nothing, 'cause I didn't order anything. No goddamn sense in you coming over here, 'cause you're not getting a penny. You're full of shit if you think you're gonna get anything.
Guns that own men? What are guns that own men? What's chimp? Huh? A package of chimp? A package from Anwar Sadat? You tell me.

Good afternoon, Manzanita Outfitters, Matthew speaking.
Matthew, my name's Schneider...Webb.
Yes sir.
I wanted to get outfitted like a... swamp donkey.
(Laughs) Sorry?
Something of that nature.
I don't know what a swamp donkey i...What's a swamp donkey? You gotta, you gotta help me out.
(Belchy sound effects) Well, you know I'm a shepherd, that's something I've encountered many times over the years. And I'm a herder.
Okay.
You know I'm usually the one leading the cheearge.
Yeah, uhh, so are you...
(Belchy sound effects)...Yeah.
(Laughs)...Are you looking for something with greater protection, or are you looking for like...a rain jacket, or a shell? Or are you actually looking for a costume?
I'm looking for a husk.
A husk?
(belchy sound effects) Yeah.
(Laughs) I'm sorry sir, what's that sound in there?
The lady at Ooh La La said I could talk to you about it.
Oh, yeah, okay. So, I don't know, what's a husk? You mean like a corn husk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't think we'll have corn husks here.
You know, there's some rough stuff out there, when you're a shepherd. So I need something that's gonna do the job.
Yeah, yeah, I get that. Ah, maybe Cal Ranch might have something like that. They deal with more animal products, and they have feed, and stuff geared for livestock. We're more just outdoorsy gear, you know, like tents and sleeping bags and rain jackets.
(belchy sound effects) Yeah, well I'm not sitting here playing Whack-A-Mole, fella. It's some rough stuff up 'ere, you know what I mean?
Yeah, it is.
Anything to make like, look like a porcupine? Something of that type?
(Laughs) A porcupine? Uhhh, no, I mean, yeah. There's another place, Off The Grid, they got like camo paint and stuff like that, if you just kinda wanted to blend in. I don't know, I'm not really sure about these.
(Belchy sound effects) Sure. The swamp donkey thing, can you just make something customized, perhaps.
(Laughs) I don't even know. (Laughs. Quick sound effect and clerks laughter continues.) Yeah, I'm sorry sir, I don't think we're gonna be able you out there, with the swamp donkey.
Well I'm tossing tranquilizer darts on a daily basis.
You're taking tranquilizer darts on a daily basis? (Laughs)
(Quick sound effect) No, I'm throwing them, sir. As part of my job.
Oh.
I'm a herder. I lead the cheearge, that's what I do.
(Laughs) Right, right, yeah.

Alright, yeah, sorry man. Don't think we got anything like that, but feel free to come by the store. Bye.

Good afternoon, Manzanita Outfitters, Matthew speaking.
Yeah, what do you guys got going on over there? A darn bingo game?
I don't know why you're asking me if this is a bingo parlor, sir. You're the one calling us.
I'm just trying to get some information here.
Yeah, but I've talked to you first sir. Listen, we ca...this isn't, this isn't a game. This isn't a joke. This is a business.
Are you Barefoot Bob? Or who are ya? I don't even know who I'm talkin' to.
I just told you my name when I picked up the telephone, sir. I'm not gonna play this game with you. If you call back again, we're gonna call the police, okay?
I'm a paying customer.
Okay man, but listen, you're not making sense. You're asking us for things we don't have. We don't have a porcupine suit. We don't have a swamp donkey suit.
But the lady at...
Okay, I'm serious man. If you call back again, I'm gonna write your telephone number down, and then we're gonna call the police.
I'm furious with you. I really am.
Okay, what do you need sir?
I want to look like a holographic donkey. End of paragraph.
Man, this is an outdoor camping outfitting store.
Yeah, well you're talkin' to a shepherd, so no one knows more about it than I do, frankly.
Then you're gonna have to build it yourself. We don't have holograms, we don't have suits here sir. Okay? This is the end of the conversation, sir. I'm serious, you can't call back. Don't disturb me or any of our other associates.
(hang up sound)
(ring)
Hello, sir, can you stop calling this store?
Just sell me some rubber boots, that's all I need.
We don't have rubber boots here.
What do you have? I'm trying to find out, but I keep getting disconnected.
Alright sir, so what we're gonna do here is, we're gonna block your number...
Just sell me some holographic boots!
We don't have any holograms, any holographs, nothing like that. Nothing. We're gonna call the police.

(Jeremy Piven) Hello?
(LPC) Mr. Piven?
(Jeremy Piven) Yeah, uh, who's this?
(LPC) Uh, this is Rocky, from the Jeopardy TV office. How ya doing?
(Jeremy Piven) Rocky from the Jeopardy TV office? You gotta come up with something better than that.
(LPC) It's the truth. Uh, Mr. Trebek is launching a new spinoff program for the network called "What's Crackin'?". He wanted me to get ya on the line, and patch you through to him, and if you're able to talk about it briefly here for a moment today.
(Jeremy Piven) That'd be fantastic, thank you.
(LPC) Okay.
(ring)
(Alek Trebek) Hello?
(Jeremy Piven) Hi!
(Alex Trebek) Hello?
(Jeremy Piven) Hello? Yeah, who's this?
(Alex Trebek) Yes? Who are you calling?
(Jeremy Piven) I don't know, I was just patched through to you.
(Alex Trebek) I'm sorry?
(Jeremy Piven) I was just patched through to you.
(Alex Trebek) Uhhh. I think what is...Where are you located?
(Jeremy Piven) Uhh, I am inside of your, umm, subconscious. And I've been with you since you've been conscious. Uh, just shortly after you exited the womb.
(Alex Trebek) Shortly after what?
(Jeremy Piven) I just...as soon as you got out of the womb, and you were conscious, I've been with you. Oh, I'm sorry, I actually at your inception, inside of the womb.
(Alex Trebek) Uh, I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying. Who are you calling?
(Jeremy Piven) I know that, that's the problem. Go inward, what I suggest is a quick ten or twenty minutes in the morning, uh, meditation, uh, and you and I will be together, and we'll be together forever, really. I just wanted to check in and say 'hello'.
(Alex Trebek) Okay...Thank you.
(Jeremy Piven) Okay, God bless. And carry on. And listen, take the high road. The glass is always half full, and I'm right there with you. God speed. (Hang up sound).
(LPC) Mr. Trebek, I've got Mr. Piven on the line.
(Alex Trebek) Who?
(LPC) Mr. Piven.
(Alex Trebek) Piven?
(LPC) Yes.
(Alex Trebek) Which Piven?
(LPC) Jeremy Piven. Let me see if I can get him back on the line.
(Alex Trebek) Oh boy. Why was, uh, why was Jeremy calling me?
(LPC) About a new program, from Viacom, called "What's Crackin'?". I'm trying to get him on the line for you again right now. I apologize...
(Alex Trebek) ...Well wait a minute. Who are you trying to get...You're trying to get Jeremy Piven on the line for who? (Ringing starts)
(LPC) For you sir.
(Alex Trebek) And my name is...Alex Trebek?
(LPC) Yes.
(Alex Trebek) Okay.
(Jeremy Piven) Hello?
(Alex Trebek) Hello, is this Jeremy?
(Jeremy Piven) Who's this?
(Alex Trebek) This is Alex Trebek.
(Jeremy Piven) I'm not quite sure I believe it, sir.
(Alex Trebek) Well (chuckles) I am. The answer is "Alex Trebek". And I was just informed that you were trying to call me.
(Jeremy Piven) Oh no, that's funny, that's so interesting. Well, we're sorry to bother you. Someone called me, and patched me through to you somehow. So someone's playing uh, a prank on both of us. But...
(Alex Trebek) I think so...
(LPC) No, it's regarding, the, the program. "What's Crackin?". We were meant to work it out here.
(Alex Trebek) Jeremy, do you know anything about this?
(Jeremy Piven) I really don't. Not a thing.
(Alex Trebek) And I don't either. Wha, what has happened in recent months, and I don't know if you've experienced this, my phone will ring, and, it will be somebody in some other part of the country whose phone rang at the same time.
(Jeremy Piven) Wow.
(Alex Trebek) Somebody has managed to come up with a system where they can call two people, and each person thinks that he's been called by the other person, and then neither one knows anything about it. So if Viacom is doing a show, Jeremy, and, uh, they want they want you to do it, listen to their proposal, and if they want me to get involved, I'll listen to their proposal. But at the moment, I have no knowledge of what the hell this is all about. But I'm an admirer of your work.
(Jeremy Piven) And, and you as well, sir. And, and listen, umm, I think you're way too busy to take on another show, and, uh, I think as your personal advisor now, and that's the way I think of myself, uh, I would advise you to take a little time off, because you work very hard.
(Alex Trebek) Well, yeah, but we only do two days a week, so I do have a lot...A lot of people think I've got it too easy, they say 'maybe you should work harder'. (Laughs)
(Jeremy Piven) Wow.
(LPC) That's why we called from "What's Crackin'?", sir.
(Alex Trebek) Okay, well hopefully somebody will figure this all out, and, uh, maybe if you and I ever run into each other, we can talk about the strangeness of this moment.
(Jeremy Piven) (Laughs) Thank you man. Well, I'll be watching you. Take care.
(Alex Trebek) Okay. Bye.
(Jeremy Piven) Bye.

Hello, this is Nick.
(echo effect) My name's Trinidad, I'm with UPS.
Ok?
And i've been trying to do a delivery here, uh, since Friday and no one's picked up, or answered the door bell.
Your name's Trinidad?
Yes.
At UPS? Well, I, I'm here.
This is on dry ice, and it's C.O.D. eighty-eight dollars and twenty-eight cents here today. (sound effects).
Oh, I think you might have the wrong address.
This is Harry? Or...
Yeah, my name is Nick Harrington.
There ya go!
You have something that's on ice?
It's Tasmanian Syrup, on dry ice.
Weird. Yeah, I don't know anything about that.
I hear that all the time. Ahh, so, uh, turn your stereo down, and I'll turn around and come back.
Ok, well, I mean when are you gonna be here?
I'm gonna be there when I get done eating lunch. (sound effects). And, so, I need a check prepared, or a money order. (sound effects).
Yeah, no, no, this doesn't sound right to me. I didn't order any of this. I have no idea what you're talking about.
You're Harry, right?
No, I'm Nick. My last name is Harrington.
Well there ya go.
There I go, what?
Look, I've been working here for months now.
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
(Sound effects through entire line) Heloooooo? This is UPS. What appears to be the trouble up here? Can you talk to me a little bit about this now?
What is this background repeating? What is that background sound that I'm hearing?
My background? Uhhhh, I'm a deliveryman, professional deliveryman. Uhh, been here for about three and a half months. And I've got a big tub of Tasmanian Syrup that you ordered that I need payment for. I need it today.
Ok, well I didn't order that, so you gotta go in a different direction.
What's your background?
Who the? What?!?
(hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hey man, listen, stop calling me. I don't know what this syrup thing you're talking about is, but I have no interest in having syrup. Stop calling.
This is Harry, I'm a supervisor here at UPS. Apparently you've had some trouble with our driver?
What is your name, sir?
Harry. I'm a supervisor here at United Parcel Service.
Ok, uh, if you're a supervisor at UPS, can you give me a contact number there, that I could call to confirm that?
Uh, who's the manager here, you or me?
Are you fucking kidding me right now? I've been out of town for a week. I never ordered any fucking syrup. And I don't appreciate you calling me and telling me I have to have a check ready for you for something I didn't fucking order.
Can I just ask you a question, sir? Tru...
...Sure.
True or false, You're full of excuses? True or false? Because I uhhhhh...
This is so weird. Your name is Terry and you work for UPS?
Yes it is.
Ok.
Yeah.
And, and, what location do you work for, please?
(Sound effects) I'm a veteran.
I mean I appreciate you being a veteran, but why don't you tell me what location you work for?
Uh, I'm out of the Appalachian, uh, Division. (Echo effects) So why don't you step up to the plate, quit horsing around, and cut a check to our driver when he come back?
Is this really how you call people, telling them this shit? If you work for UPS, you wouldn't talk to people like that...(dog barks in background and LPC sound effects are heard)...so this is just bullshit.
I want you to put your dog away. I want you to turn your stereo off. And I want you to sit tight.
I don't give a fuck what you want me to do.
(Strange sound effects)
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Alright bro, come on over.
Hello?
Come over now, you, you, hello?
I'm Jack Maniacky. I'm a district manager...
I don't give a fuck...
...United Parcel Service
...I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. You've called me five times now, with a different name every single time. If you want to come to my house, try stepping on my property. Come to my house, come on. I'm here.
This is my first time calling you. I don't know what you're referring too.
I,I,I don't give a fuck. I've had three different names given to me from UPS. I think you're full of shit, telling me about some Tasmanian Syrup. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. And then you're telling me I have to have a check up for you when you come to my house after finishing lunch? Come to my house, bro. Fucking come to my house.
My name's Jack Maniacky. I'm not a driver, I'm a regional manager.
I don't care.
Do you understand that?
What is your fucking problem here?
You've got a surcharge. You've got a poor attitude, if you ask me.
I've got a poor attitude? Really?
Yeah.
Stop calling me. Stop calling here...
Our driver's been out there four times. What would you call it?
I, I don't care. I didn't order this stuff. You do your job, I'm gonna do mine. Your driver's getting paid. Who lets a man get paid for driving around? I don't give a shit. I didn't order this fucking syrup. Stop calling me.
I don't believe you, first of all.
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not. I didn't order it.
I see this kind of thing all the time. People change their mind, they bounce checks... ("bounce checks" repeats with sound effects).
I've been out of town for a week. I don't even eat Tasmanian Syrup. I, I use real Vermont maple syrup, bro. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, stop calling me.
Can I just ask you a question?
Sure.
True or False, you're full of excuses? True or False?
Oh my gosh, dude. Stop calling me, that's it. I'm gonna report this to the police, alright?
I'll send ya to Tasmania and you can go to the source on this stuff. What do you say to that?
Cool, bring it to my house. Br, bring it.
I'll bring it. I'll bring it to your chin bone, what do you think of that? (Sound effects).
He said he's gonna bring it to my chin bone. Yeah.
I think you're bananas, fella. I really do.
That's fine, you can think I'm bananas all you want. I mean I don't really care if you want to come to my house and bring this fucking weird Tasmanian Syrup here. I don't care. Come to my house, bro.
Well it's about time you start caring, because we're trying to do our job, here. (Sound effects persist through all of next line).
I'm here. I don't know why you're still talking to me. I'm telling you I'm here right now. If you want to come to my house, I'll deny the package...
I'm gonna whoop ya in the ass! I'm gonna whoop ya...
You're gonna whoop me, huh? (laughs). Alright, well if you have a package to deliver here, I'll just deny it, and that person delivering it can continue to get paid.
There's nothing to deny. You made the order, end of discussion.
Okay, so bring it to my house then, if I did. Go ahead bring it, fine.
Who's full of excuses, you or me?
Oh my gosh dude, this is a waste of my time. I have to go about my day.
You're wasting our time with these falsified orders that you're placing in Tasmania, or wherever else you go.
(sigh) I just came into town last night from being away for a week. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I hear that every day, 'oh I was here, I was there. I was everywhere else.' But where you're supposed to be, is answering the doorbell. You feel me? (sound effects).
No, I don't feel you, bro. I don't know who...you just sound like an ignorant, ignorant ass right now...
Is that a matter of fact?
...who says he works for the United Postal Service.
Who's ignorant? It's United PARCEL Service. Not Postal service.
Ok, sure, United PARCEL Service. I don't give a fuck. I don't know what the fuck you want from me, but I have nothing to say to you. I'm not gonna pay you, I don't know you, I didn't order this product.
Who's ignorant, me or you?
Oh my gosh.
You can't even remember three words.

Well, Un, unfortunately this isn’t Bill, but I wish it was.
Oh, I am. I wish I wasn’t sometimes, but, it’s uh, for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. I have a giant boxing ring that I’ve built. It’s right off Mulholland Drive, and it’s me, you, Chris Elliot, and we just get in there, beat the hell out of each other, and raise some money…

Uh-huh. (Sound effects). We’ve also got Cyndi Lauper and Blythe Danner, they’re gonna get in there and just beat the hell out of each other, raise a few dollars. (Sound effects).

Yeah man, you guys got any stencils up 'ere? This is your neighbor. We got a band, Tweak Deacon, and we're just tryin' to stencil it out.
I don't, I..I..It's not ringing any bells, to be honest.
Do you have like ten, fifteen dollars we can get somebody else to make a stencil for us?
I'm not following this conversation at all, I'm sorry.
Well, Tweak Deacon is our band. We're named after that one dude, he's all gacked out, but it's OK. It's a cool name, and it's too good not to be stenciled, so...I don't know what to doooo. (Sound effects). Do you maybe want to hear us for a second first? It’s like… (Drum beat starts).
I don’t even know what the call is about. But you aren’t making any sense to me, and I’m really not interested.
We’re really trying to put a stencil together.
I don’t understand what you’re calling us for. We’re a music distributor. I don’t know what you mean by a stencil. We don’t make stencils.
(Sound effects). We’re a new band. Let’s just come up there, and we’ll try to see what we can put together. Does that sound good?
I’m not interested. I’m not following this story. I’m not interested. We’re a music distributor, we’re not a stencil maker.
(Music plays into the next call) Tweak Deacon. Do you like the name at least?
I, uh, is this a joke? I, I, I’m confused.

I’m calling from the San Clemente Police Department.
I don’t care! Wha, what’s the telephone number you’re calling me on?
It, it’s uh, private line, sir. For the police department.

Taxi cabs?

Oh.
But maybe you’ll luck out, and one of them will want service, because I don’t.
What happened? Did somebody put some advertisements on your door?
Yeah. So I’ll check back with you and find out how many cabs actually showed up, and what happened, ok?
(Laughs) You know, well, I, you know, I’m not really sure (hard to understand) You’d have to ask my boss.
You can let him know. What’s his name? Don?
Yeah.
Yeah
That’s really nice of you Colt.
Ok, cool.
Can you send some donuts and coffee?
Psssh, I doubt it.
Ah, come on!

That’s pretty funny.
You should feel ba…It is funny, I mean I was laughing too, but you should feel bad for them, dude. You know, you’re making people run around for no reason.
Did you get some food?
We got Dominoes dude, but we couldn’t take it.
Dominoes?
You sent it before lunch, bro. No one eats it.
Ohhhhhh.
No, but honestly man, it not a cool call. I mean, you know, you kind of, you know, you’re hurting other people’s business.
I sent two limousines down there too, before five.
Two limos? Befor…Colt, do you work dude? I don’t understand.
This is work. What do you think, this phone just dials itself?
It is kind of cool.
Yeah, it’s alright.
I’m not sure what you want to do, man. I mean, my boss will be here soon, if you want to leave me a number, I’ll have him call you back.
Yeah. You have caller ID, just call me back.
Yeah, but we called, your phone number is just going to voice mail, like you don’t want to pick up.
I don’t want to pick up. You’re right.
(Laughs) Then why’d you say ‘call me back’? Make up your mind, buddy.
Well, you can leave a message, and don’t leave any more fliers.
What fliers are you talking about?
Your fliers. They’re everywhere. They’re in my yard, they’re in my driveway.
How many fliers did you get?
This week?
Yeah.
Two. And it’s only Tuesday.
Ok, you got two fliers this week?
Yeah. So now, I’m gonna come down and knock you around a little bit. What do you think of that one?
You’re gonna knock me out?
Yeah.

You got it.

Hey, this is Danny
Hey, this is Tim.
Tim?
Yeah, I work out at Tongue Jam as a session man. I was talkin' to ya at the park.
Oh, okay, cool.
Yeah I was tryin' to get ya in the band, Molecular Lionel?
Oh, okay. Yeah uh-yeah, actually I'm havin' trouble rememberin' which parts.
I was thinkin' we just come out; we hump it lyrically, you know what I mean? Just me, you, and uh one dude Hicky. Just hook you up. Get hype, ya know?
It sounds good man, I dunno anything that you're talkin' about but it sounds like a great plan.
We talked about this, playboy, in the park.
Yeah? Yeah?
We're thinkin', you know
[whoa]
, the first show we come out there with no ladders.
Right?
We primp you out. We ramp ya up. Just do a real ear-slammer, the whole thing.
Yeah, ear-slammer, I like ear-slammers, man.
Uuuuhh-you know what I'm sayin'?
Mmmhmm
Just tappin' one or two strings.
Yeah, yeah. Two is too many. Two is too many.
At first we will be going in... twelve directions comin' out of this chamber, know what mean?
Right, right.
Aaand Hicky just has his one stick he'll be tappin'
[Yeah]
That's how people will be feelin' him, at first, ya know? Ya know?
Yeah. I think twelve directions is too many. I do- I think we need to do one direction.
Then we start pipin' you up sayin' "Johny's got a sack." Just you, me, and Hicky.
Right
People'll be bumpin' up, uh, Hicky's rack. Ya know? Ya know?
Mmmhmm. I love it. I love it.
[You got...]
I'm on board.
You got your equo-neck?
Mhm, yeah. I got my equo-neck and my equo-neck's echo.
So you just take your equo-neck and have it, you know, Molecular Lionel. So what
[I love it. I love it]
I'm proposin' then we go in about twenty four different directions after that; just take off all the strings on
[After the echo?]
everything, ya know?
[Mhm]
Just keep one string crackin'. Just one string
[mhm]
, and then we'll plump ya up.
Yeah, man. I... I love gettin' plumped.
Like a... analog dog toy, ya feel me?
Yeah, man, I do. Hey, how's the weather there, man?
Uh, it's fair. You know? It's fair. So, you just keep on tappin; eventually we're gonna get all fretless and stringless like a pipe down.
[Yeah]
Ya know what I mean?
Yup
Then we come back out and hype you up like a scarecrow playboy kinda thing.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
No, but ya know?
I do know man, I already knew.
You can just start out like beep beep beeep, right?
Mmhmm, that's too much.
Keep the park people beepin, ya know?
Right, keep 'em beepin'.
Then we roll Hicky out there in his clam-van.
Yeah.
We talked about this.
Yeah, no, I remember I remember this entire conversation happening exactly like this, word for word, the last time.
I got this rhythm I've been workin' on.
*Rhythm plays*
That's just a portion.
That's perfect, man. That's really beautiful.
Just get it hype, ya know? So the people in the park can plug ya in-n-out, ya know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah. That's sideways.
So we're just gonna get ya maxed out.
Cool, man. That's how I want to be.
Like a dog toy, ya know?
Yeah. Like, yeah
[So]
, no one could ask for anything more, man.
You better hop to it.
Okay, I'm doin' it. I'm on it.
So image-wise we're gonna need ya to be beard-headed.
Yeah, I can do that. Just that- I turn it around.
It's gonna be good. Be in the park, get the park people beepin' and we're gonna primp ya up, plump ya out like an ear-slam tongue-jam.
Yeah. I'm on board, man.
You just keep one string crackin', awright?
Yeah. I do it man. I thank you for everything you do and your vision.
Have at it, man.
Yeah
Have at it and and we'll plump ya up, ya know?
Yeah, this is, uh, this is a beautiful thing. Well thanks, man, I appreciate it.
And then I'll rub ya down on your feet.
Do it. Yeah. Perfect.
I'll touch ya.
All right, I'll touch ya later.
Touch ya.
Touch ya, too.
Late.
Bye.
Hello, Fish On The Grill.
Yeah, I came in there and I had some barbecued chicken.
Mhm.
And this-this stuff just tasted sulfuric. You know one of those sulfur baths that you get into? This stuff was real strange, so.
Did you order it just recently?
Yes, I did...Miss.
Alright, let me check through the receipts. Hold on.
Oh, it was bizarre. So, you know what I'd really like is, like, a profiterole frittata. You guys come up with something like that and I'm happy to let the whole thing go. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I don't know what that is. I don't know what you're saying.
Well, why dontcha try listenin' up? I had a weird experience in there.
Yes, I hear that. I'm looking for the order in the computer so I can reprint the receipt.
I've got the receipt.
Alright, you ordered it today?
No! I didn't.
Well, how am I supposed to know when you ordered it when you're not giving me any information. You just said you ordered it, you didn't tell me when.
You didn't ask. It was like somebody snuck up and put a match into my chicken! You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I-I-I watch the cooks, they don't light matches in the food.
Coulda fooled me. Why don't you just cook me a profiterole frittata to go and I'll just forgive the
whole
mess, okay?
I would have to talk to the owner about it.
Oh, I talked to the owner. He said to just give a call in and that you'd cook up what I
neeeeed
Okay, but we don't have that frittata, whatever you're saying.
Profiterole.
You're saying that you want a frittata! We don't have that!
It's made outta profiterole, it's
real, real
good.
Yes, but we don't have the ingredients. We don't have that. You can only order what we have from the menu.
I need this tonight for dinner!
You need to stop with the prank calls, seriously, I'm trying to work.
I need a frittata made
to-night
I-I don't have time for your bullshit, stop calling.
It's just a frittata for freak's sake.
Stop calling. I'm tired of the prank calls.
Just quit playin' games and give me a dollar amount and I'll pay it!
You stop playing games. Stop fucking calling!
[ring]
Gianni's Bistro.
Yeah, I'm calling from Fish On The Grill. My boss here, Lauren, says that we needed to get some profiterole and I wanted-cuz we don't serve that-I was wondering if there was any chance we can purchase some from you this once.
For how many people?
About twelve people we have coming through. It'd be Monday.
So, uh, for twelve people, we're looking at, uh, uh, two-four-five portion, right?
Yeah, about that.
Yeah, because you don't want to do more, you don't want to do less. Are you gonna be serving them on the plate?
Yes.
Then you're gonna need five for each, and, uh, twelve people, yeah, no problem, yes.
Can you do me a favor and just talk to my boss, uh, Lauren, and just tell her how we can work this out?
Okay.
I'll put ya through, here.
Thank yous.
[ring]
Ahem...
Hello, Fish On The Grill.
Yes, I may speak to L-Lauren, please?
Not here right now.
Excuse me?
Not here.
O-Okay, uh, somebody from your company called me because you guys wanna purchase for Monday about twelve portion of profiterole, I'm calling from Gianni's Bistro in San Ramon, and he put me through to speak to Lauren, so, ahem, I don't know we-be-gonna go about.
I have no idea what any of that is.
Okay, it, are you a manager?
No, I'm not.
Can I speak to a manager, please?
They're not in right now.
Okay. Let me give you, uh, the phone number to call, please. Tell me when you're ready.
So, I don't know-I-what is this about?
Okay, let me repeat myself. A gentleman that works with you, but obviously was calling from headquarters, from the office, call me and they said that you guys, Fish On Fire, need twelve portion of profiteroles for Monday. So that's why he said, "Let me put you through Lauren so you can talk to her."
Yeah, I don't know anything about that. There's only three people that work here and there's only women. We don't-no one else works here.
I was talking to this gentleman and he put me through to you directly, to your phone number without dialing.
I don't know who would, maybe it was a prank call. Yesterday I got a bunch of prank calls, maybe that's who called you. Cuz no one else did.
Yeah, but, but, the guy knew the name of Lauren.
Yeah, that was probably the prank call.
Okay, anyway, ahem, my name is Gianni. I'm calling from Gianni's Bistro. Is Lauren gonna come in today?
For what?
Is she coming in or not?
Who?
Lauren!
Yes, but for what? I don't even-
What I need to speak to her about a man because perhaps it's important!
I don't-
Can you do this? Hello?
[hangs up]
Hello?
Yes, sir?
Yes. Hi, who is this?
Oh, I'm calling from Fish On The Grill, here.
Ahem, what's your name?
My name is Aydalia.
Aydalia, my name is Gianni, I'm calling from Gianni's Bistro in San Ramon. I talked to-your-the call she said she doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Sorry about that. Let me try one more time.
Okay, sure, go ahead.
[ring]
Hello?
Hello?
Yes? Hello?
Am I speaking to Lauren?
No, I don't know what you're talking about!
(scoff) Okay, this is kind of awkward and strange. When you-when you switch over to somebody, Aydalia his name is, who's Aydalia?
She...is workin'.
Well that's is-he just switched me over to speak to Lauren because she's in, he told me.
Okay. Whaddya want?
I wanna speak...to
Lauren. To Lauren.
Alright, I hear you! For what, what do you need to talk to her about?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not gonna...I'm not gonna keep callin' you guys because, you know, you guys called
me
. I didn't call
you
. Aydalia keeps switching-
We're not calling you! We're not calling you!
Yes, you did! Twice!
Bullshit.
[hangs up]
Hello?
Hello there, sir?
Aydalia, listen up, okay?
Uh-huh?
This girl, you keep switching on to-to her and she said to me, "What I want?"
She said, "What do
you
want?"
Yes! I keep explaining myself that you something from me and now, when you switch the phone over to another section, this young lady picks up she says, "What I want?" You tell this lady that pick up the phone not to be so rude! Go ahead!

This is the San Ramon Police Department, this is Dave, how may I help you?
Hi, yeah, I've been having trouble with my...telephone.
Telephone?
Yeah, I have a restaurant. Is there anyway you just call me back and see if my phone even...works?
Well, I could sure give it a try. What are you at, sir?
Right here in San Ramon, Fish On The Grill restaurant.
Hang on a second, just a second, let me get a different pencil...
Yeah.
...that's sharp.
Yes, sir.
Yep, I just got stopped by the supervisor. I just checked with them and they said you'll have to contact AT&T. We can't do a thing for ya. I got stopped by the supervisor.
Oh...Give it another try and I'll just see what happens, okay?
Well, you can try. I cannot, sir. I'm very, very busy. We've got other people coming in here to the police department, we've got umpteen phone calls, but you...they said you will have to work with AT&T on it.
That'll work.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
(Ring)
Paul Crowell speaking.
(LPC) Yes sir, uhhhh, I’m trying to find a way to cry more of my own natural tears, and reduce dry eye. Could you possibly...possibly…
I’m sorry, this is, uh, an office at The University of Minnesota. I’m in the physics department.
Sure. I’m just trying to increase tear production in my eyes, and I, uh, got your number from the operator.
Maybe they thought physiology? I’m a physicist, i don’t know anything about it, I’m sorry. I’m a solid state physicist.
I guess you don’t know anything about optics, then? (Echo effect) I take it.
I know optics as in optics for lasers and such.
(SFX - pitch lowered) I’m a spelunker, that’s probably what caused this whole deal. I’ve got a seeing eye falcon, that I brought with me, back from Dubai, and that kind of helps me a little bit. But what can I do to, uh, produce more tears in my eyes?
Yeah, ‘cause that, that sounds like a physiology question.
(SFX)Yeah.
I mean, uh…
(SFX) well…
Did, did they put you in contact with someone in the medical school?
(SFX) They told me to, they told me to talk to you. They said that you would be the person to a(sk). I mean, are your optics even clean, your own self? Or, are they dirty?
Umm, my optics are inside a laser cavity. I don’t work with anything that’s wet. In essence I…
(LPC interrupts) Yeah.
...I try to avoid water at all costs.
Fella, my eyes are dry as a bone, frankly. (Echo sfx)
Okay, I, I don’t know anything about eyes and tears, or moisture.
How do I cry more of my own natural tears?
Except for putting drops in your eyes, I just wouldn’t know.
How about liquid helium? (Echo effects) Is that something I could maybe try? I don’t know, what do you think? What do you think?
That will not solve your problem.
(SFX) Why?
It’s a cryogenic fluid.
(SFX) Whaaaa. I’m not trying to live forever, I’m just trying to produce more tears.
I just can’t do anymore to help. Bye bye.
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
(SFX) Hi, I’m your new neighbor. I’m trying to cry more of my own natural tears, and increase tear production. Uh, what should I do?
I don’t know how to make people cry.
I need to make my eyes more tearful. (SFX)
That sounds awesome. Maybe you should go watch a sad movie. Garlic might make you cry, or onions.
(SFX) Uhhh, is there anything physical I can do?
Maybe you can whip yourself?
Hit myself?
Sure, I don’t know. Don’t ask me, I don’t do these weird things.
I’m trying to increase tear production.
Well, ask your optometrist.
(lots of SFX) Well what advice do you have?
(Laughs) You’re funny.
What should I dooo?
I think you might need a therapist.
What can you tell me?
That you’re funny.
How can I make my eyes more tearful? (pitch shift sfx and echo repeat) full, full, full, full…
(Laughs) Use eye drops. (Laughs)
Okay, well I’m trying to find a way, or I might have to move.
We have too many people here, they need to move out.
Well, can you make my eyes more tearful (SFX) for me?
You’d have to pay me a lot of money. I get paid forty bucks an hour.
(SFX) Ohhhhh yeeeaaaah. Ohhhh yeeeaaaah. I’ll do it! Ohhhh Yeeeeah.
(Laughs) You’re very amusing. Thank you for cheering me up. You just made my day.
How about you and me get together and cry some natural tears. That sound good?
(Laughs) What?
(Very high pitched) What should I do? (SFX)
Oh my God, you are the funniest prank phone caller, ever in the world. So, you have a good afternoon.
Bye.
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
This is Adam.
Hi, yeah, this is Goldie. I’m new to the area, and it’s really dry here, I’m trying to increase tear production in my eyes. What advice do you have? (SFX) Tell me what to do.
Oh, this is crazy, this is like a prank call. Is this Longmont Potion Castle?
No, I live in Wheat Ridge.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, the Postmaster gave me your number. (SFX) What advice do you have? Is what I’m trying to find out.
I’d say that you should like, onion up your face, hard. You’re trying to get more tear production? Like extreme tear production?
I’m trying to cry more of my own tears (SFX and echo) s, s, s, s, s…
Ohhhh. This is so fucking amazing right now. I wish every day was like this.
Can you tell me what to do? I’m new to the area. I got your number from the operator.
Yeah, I would say…
(High pitched SFX) Anything you can tell me would be great. Anything you can tell me would be really great.
Oh, this is so awesome right now. I don’t know.
(Crazy SFX) I need to cry more of my own natural tears.(Crazy SFX)
That’s fuckin’ awesome.
Don’t leave me hanging.
No, onion up the face. Onion up the face. I got some raw ass onions over here, we’ll pull ‘em right outta the ground. Come on over, I’ll slice ‘em open, I’ll rub ‘em right in your eyes.
Then I’ll give you something to cry about, there tough guy. What do you think of that? (High pitched SFX) No doubt in my mind. There’s no doubt in my mind, period. (SFX) You’re gonna be exterminated, end of sentence. (Very low pitched SFX) End of sentence. End of paragraph. You’re gonna be exterminated, buddy. (Low pitched SFX) I’m gonna whoop ya in the ass.
That’s awesome. That’s so quality. This is classic right now. I can’t believe you’re prank calling me. This is so cool.
(High pitched SFX) I’m gonna whoop ya ass! I’m gonna whoop ya ass!
Oh, this is so good.
(High pitched) I’m gonna whoop ya ass!
This is so good right now.
(High pitched SFX) I’m gonna whoop ya ass! I’m gonna whoop ya ass!

Why don't you start counting the ways in which you can help?
Nope. Don't care about it. Win, lose draw. I don't get anything out of it. Could care less.
You're gonna get a couple black eyes out of the deal if you don't help out.
Oh. Could care less. Come on over. I got plenty of baseball bats to take care of ya.
No, we need you thinkin' football here, not baseball.

What?
Yes. Sir, Mike Shanahan again. Can we count on you for some input today. Would be really valuable.
Hey! Look idiot. I'm not even watching the game. I don't care.
Hey. I'm Mike Shanahan, okay? And I just need a little--
So?! Big deal! Go live in your McMansion and leave me the hell alone!
We need some input. Big time.
[Sound of a phone button being pressed]
Well, what are you watching, then?
[Sound of a phone button being pressed]
What's the big idea there?
[Hang up]
[Ringing]
Hello?
This is Mike Shanahan, former head coach of the Denver Broncos. We're just looking for some input on what the team can do to pull through here today in the big game.
Ummm... Better defense.
Better defense. Let's see... okay. How about offensively? Any suggestions you might have would be
really
valuable to us.
Yeah. Make sure they... cover their... quarterback.
Cover--
They're playing lousy.
Cover their quarterback. Okay. Any chance you and I gettin' together, tossin' the ball around a little bit later?
Uhhhh I don't think so.
How about you give it some thought and I call back and then we work somethin' out?
Okay. That's fine.
Can you have some chips and salsa ready for me?
Oh, I-- I have a lot of that. Potato salad, got a [item of food], ribs. You name it, I got it.
Rib cage?
Yep.
Dynamite.
Okay.
I'll be there.
Okay. Bu-bye.
Bu-bye.
(Calling to the number in the first two calls)
[Phone ringing]
Howdy, this is Mike Shanahan.
You call again, I call the police. You got that? Do not call
again
Just give me some advice--
Callin' the DA's office. (To the guy who answered the phone in the first to calls.)
You calling the DA's office? K.
Are you gonna accept a call from the Colorado state DA?
Hey! The Broncos are on the move right now.
You're on the move?
Yes, we're runnin' up and down the field.
Why don't you go run into a tree?

Note: "Trebek's Pouch" was recorded live during a telephone interview with LPC on
the November 11, 2013 episode of the
Illogical Contraption
podcast
. LPC considered calling Jeremy Piven, Buzz Osbourne and Dale Crover before ultimately deciding on Trebek. "Trebek's Pouch" was later released as a bonus track to
Longmont Potion Castle 11.
Hello?

Hello?
Yeah. Uh, this is, uh, Dusty with DHL. We've been tryin' to get through, sir, and no one's answered the bell each and every time we've been out there.
Uh...
So
[echoes]
... do you have any explanation?
Uh, no. We've been
home
for the past two days, Dusty. And what's the, uh, delivery? Is it a package, is it an envelope, or...?
It's a pouch.
A pouch.
Yeah.
[echoes]
And... and there's money to be paid, uh, for it?
COD, yes sir.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Oh. Well, that sounds kinda strange 'cause I called DHL after I spoke with you, uh, uh, yesterday or - I guess it was early yesterday - and they said that, uh, if there's ever COD to be paid, the
office
calls first, so -
Well, that's what I'm doin'.
Yeah? Are you at the office or are you the delivery man?

Hello?
Yes this is Feeley with United Parcel Service. (echo)
Yes?
I'm with UPS sir.
Yes?
Uhh, we've tried to come out there twice, for a shipment...
Out where, sir?
Uhh, I'm in Culver City at the district headquarters. We've got plaster of paris...
What's the address you're trying to deliver to, sir?
It's a big cluster of parcels we've got, and uh, just wanted to know when you're gonna be around t...
What is the address you're trying to deliver to? I don't know who you are. What is the address you're trying to deliver to?
My name is Feeley. I'm a regional manager at UPS. And uh...
Ok, and what is the address you are trying to deliver to?
We're at 3220 Olympic Boulevard.
I don't need your address, I need to know what address you are trying to deliver the package to.
This thing is C.O.D. We've been out there twice.
Then, it's not to me.
It says it for Mister Sutherlander, and uhh...
I ordered nothing C.O.D. and, it's not for me.
It's from the Ho Ho House, and it's plaster of paris. Now, what plaster of paris is, is a compound...
...I know what plaster of paris is. I'm not paying for anything C.O.D., and I have not ordered anything, so...
Well, our driver is coming back en route to you with an interpreter. He is English as a second language. He's Bangladeshi. And us, just need to see some identification when he gets there.
And again, I'm not going to be here. I can't express to you strongly enough, I ordered nothing. And I am not accepting anything C.O.D.
Well, what plaster of paris is, it's a compound, it can't dry, it has to be conta...
I know what plaster of paris is, but send it back to whoever sent it.
Sir, just take reci...
I did not order it.
I've got your signature. I've got you digital signature.
You do not have my signature, and you do not have my digital signature, because I don't have a computer. That's impossible. Uh, give me the name of whoever I can call that is above you.
It's from the Ho Ho House, sir.
I don't care. I don't know what that is. And you're telling me I'm accepting a parcel C.O.D., and that is just not true. I have never signed nor ordered for anything like that. You cannot give me the address where I live, so clearly it's not coming to me.
I've given you the address.
And I'm telling you, I don't know what that address is.
That's where we're located. We've been here for 32 years at the same location.
That's where you're located.
Yes, sir.
If someone was sending me something and they knew me, they'd be sending it to my address. I'm telling you, send it back to whoever sent it to you, it is not mine.
It's yours, you could pick it up from our dock if you'd prefer.
I'm not picking anything up. I didn't order anything, it's not for me.
Check or credit card required. (sound effects) Ok, so if you could bring that with you.
And...I'm not doing any such thing. Umm, you can send the package back, but I did not order it, nor is it mine.
I'm a regional manager. Plaster of paris, is what the contents are, I'm looking right at...
I don't care. I'm telling you, someone has sent you something that I have nothing to do with, nor do I want...
I'm looking right at the packing slip.
...nor have I ordered. And you can't tell me my address or my name. I work as an actor, I am, uh, relatively famous, I can not tell you who sent this to you, it has nothing to do with me is all I'm saying to help you out.
So this is an act, you're saying? (sound effects) How do you want us to proceed, is my question.
(hang up sound)

Hello?
Yes, this is Sweeney with UPS uh, what's what's...
...yeah, and I said I'm not picking up the package, I did not order it, and I said have a great day.
What's the trouble out here, sir.
I didn't order it. I have no idea what you're talking about, and I did not (unintelligible) I don't know what the Ho Ho House is, I don't need a secondary language interpreter to explain to me what it is, and I'm certainly not paying for something that is not mine.
That's why I'm calling, I'm a statewide manager for United Parcel Service.
You were a regional manager two seconds ago, but OK.
That was my associate, I'm the manager here.
Ok. And my name is Kiefer Sutherland, and people send stuff all the time. I have not ordered this, I do not want it.
I have been told by our vice-president we can take PayPal.
I'm not paying you anything.
Well, what is the hold up here? You said you're putting on an act...
...Send it back to whoever sent it to you.
Are you putting on an act of some kind? Is what I've been told, that's why the interpreter's involved. Sir, do you want to pick it up, or have it delivered?
I do not want either. I do not want either...
Why? (echo)
...And if you insist on bothering me, if you insist on bothering me, I will have my lawyer return your call at this number. What is your name again?
I'm Sweeney.
What is your first name?
That is my first name. Dixon is my las...
What is your last name?
Sweeney Dixon.
Sweeney Dixon, excellent. I'll have someone call you right back.
I can give you my direct line, it's my DID line.
Uh-huh.
But can I get the credit card number first just to...
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. What is your number.
Ah, 1-800-PICK-UPS. It's one eight hundred...
Uh-huh
Seven, four, two, five...
Uh-huh

Holy fuck.
(NOTE: in the below calls, there are times when nothing explicitly identifies the voice of Alex Trebek, but if it sounds like him, it is labeled as such).
(Ring)
(Man’s voice) Hello?
(Alex Trebek) Yes?
Hello?
Yes?
Oh, okay, it sounded like the phone disconnected.
Wait a minute, did your phone ring?
No, but I heard a ring.
You heard it ring?
Yeah.
Okay, you’re not calling anybody (
LPC SFX in background
Ah, you just called me, didn’t you?
No, (
LPC SFX continue
) there’s, there’s somebody who’s managed to learn how to cross connect different phones so that people in different areas have their phones ring at the same time. And, uh, they all wonder what the hell’s going on, so...somebody’s having fun at our expense. Where are you? I’m in Southern California.
I am too.
Oh, okay, well, hopefully they’ll get tired of screwing with us.
(LPC with lots of effects) It’s just too bad. I can’t really imagine.
(Alex) Yeah. Who’s that other voice.
(LPC) Huh? (Lots of effects)
(Alex) Okay!
(LPC) I can’t figure it out.
(Alex) I can’t either.
(LPC) I can’t figure it out. (SFX) What’s that now? (new call sound).
(Ring)
(Alex) Hello?
(Wax Museum) Hi, I guess they transferred me to you. I, I’m part of the Hollywood Wax Museum.
(Alex) Oh, okay.
(WM) And I guess you were trying to get a, a wax figure made?
(Alex) I was? Who transferred you?
(WM) Uh, Rocky.
(Alex) Rocky said this?
(WM) That’s what Rocky said. (Laughs)
(Alex) Yeah, are you sure you got the right person? Who are you calling?
(WM) I, I spoke to Rocky, and he said that he was gonna transfer me to you. I guess to do a wax figure of you, for Alex. And pretty much just to get some more information on it.
(Alex) Well, who wants a wax image of me?
(WM) Rocky.
(Alex) Rocky does?
(WM) Yeah, that’s what he said.
(Alex) Hmmm. Ah, well, you’ve taken me completely by surprise, I know nothing about this, so…
(WM) (Laughs) Sorry. I heard about it. I, I know that he’s been calling a couple time to see if it’s something that we can do.
(Alex) Yeah, let me talk to Rocky about this and find out (
LPC SFX start
) what’s going on.
(WM) (
LPC SFX continue
) Okay, will do.
(Alex) Thank you.
(LPC SFX continue to end of call).
(Touch tone dialing sounds)
(LPC) Viacom, hello? (LPC sfx start)
(Alex) Uhh, Viacom? Boy did I misdial. Sorry about that.
(LPC) Yes, sir, who are you trying to reach here?
(Alex) Uh, I’m trying to dial an outside line.
(LPC) Uh, apparently you’re trying to procure a sculpture.
(Alex) No. (No I’m not)
(LPC) Who am I speaking with?
(Alex) You’re speaking with Alex Trebek, and I’m not trying to secure anything. So, I will try again.
(LPC) Yes, sir.
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Pro Drum.
(LPC playing audio from previously made calls) “I’ve just got tons and tons of songs and arrangements, and I’ve got ‘em for every style: Latin, Rock, Jazz, you know, just amazing man.”
You got it all?
“I can mix different styles. I can put in like a jazz thing with a rock thing with a flamenco thing. It’s just crazy man, It’s like endless, you know, with all the different styles.”
That’s awesome!
(unintelligible) “...records, man.”
Fuckin’ awesome!
“You know I could start working with other singers and tell them ‘look, you got to pay me hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this, and it’s like, you know…(laughs)”.
(Laughs) What’s going on?
“I’ve just recently found that you can mix tempos. I put four four tempos into sixteenth tempos (LPC drums sounds start).”
Fuck yeah, three against four. Two against two. One on one. That's some great basketball games.
“You know, just because it sounds better. Let me play you something real quick, just so you get an idea. (LPC Saxophone SFX start). Wait a minute, I don’t have it plugged in. (Sax and drums sounds). Now let’s see, what was I gonna do? Ch,ch, ch, ch, ch. Oh yeah man, I just don’t have it recorded.”
Well you gotta get on that.
“I’ve got some rock things I’ve done in the past, with heavy metal and like punk music.”
Right?
“Oh, you’ll absolutely, oh yeah the rock thing, that’s easy. That’s like a piece of cake. (Sax sounds).”
Two and four. Two and four, take the money, go home.
“Yeah, I do mostly jazz, ‘cause that’s the hard shit. You know, where they’re playing something, you know, different every beat. And different inversions and chords, I mean that’s some hard shit. And then playing like Elvin Jones, you know?”
Swinging Elvin.
“But rock and roll is just dun-nuh-duh-duh-duh. (Laughs)”.
(Laughs) Two and four. Alright, well I gotta run.
“And you got, a lot of country, and then you can mix country stuff with the rock and roll, you can actually put in hip-hop and you gotta experiment around, you know.”
Got it. Alright.
“I mix things up a lot. I put different time signature instruments in with different time signature instruments. Put a different drummer on, or a different piano player, or a different guitar player.”
Yeah, fuck yeah. Cool, cool. Go on and let me know when you come on in, alright?
“You know?"

Thank you for calling Game Stop, where you can buy more with a PowerUp Rewards Credit Card, this is William speaking, how can I help you?
Yeah, William, I came in there and I rented Halo, for my game system, right.
Ok.
You with me there, ahhhh, William?
Yeah.
Yeah, and this disc kept popping out, and my controller, it was not responding, and I was conquering all kinds of stuff, but it wasn't reflected in my score, and I,I, just think this game was bunk. I figure I'm gonna need triple my rental fee back.
We don't rent games, we only sell games.
Yeah, I'm gonna need triple my che-arge refunded to me, I figure. Just for aggravation and time.
No. Sorry, we don't do that.
No?
If you (unintelligible) problem with a disc, uh, you bring it back and we swap it out for you, but that's all we do.
Ah, there's a big problem. Huge problem. Major problem.
If you found a problem with a disc, bring it back and we'll swap it out for you. We'll take care of it for you.
Man, I'm telling you, I defeated this guy, another guy. I defeated people left and right, but my score stayed at zero. At "oh".
Ahhh, I don't even know what you're talking about. You're playing Xbox Live Achievements?
Yes. It's a heck of an achievement, your game you sold me says "oh" on the score.
Oh man, there's a problem with the game, bring it back, we'll swap it out for you.
I'm gonna swap out back of my hand here if I don't get some satisfaction.
Ok, sir, you know what, you can bring it back and we'll take care of it for you and we'll swap out the game. But you know what, do not threaten me like that again, and you know what? You have a nice day.
Who do I need to talk to up 'ere?
(hang up sound)
(Ring)
Thank you for calling Game Stop, where you can buy more with a PowerUp Rewards Credit Card, this is William speaking, how can I help you?
Yeah, who, who am I talkin' to up 'ere?
It's me again, and you know what, I told you come on down with the game, we'll swap it out for you, but your behavior is just threatening now to come down with a backhand smack me, you know what, get a life, next time could you come down and we'll deal with it, and we'll have the cops here too, and we'll have a nice discussion with that.
I'm gonna swap out your teeth.
(hang up)
(ring)
Thank you for calling Game Stop, where you can buy more with a PowerUp Rewards Credit Card, this is William speaking, how can I help you?
Lookee here, bunghole.
You know what, I've already told you what we can do. You've already threatened to come down and backhand us. You know what, that is unacceptable, that is immature, I am not gonna deal with you, sir. I will take care of the game, if there is a problem with that, but that's all we're doing, and stop calling, because you are now harassing us, and I've already contacted the police. So, you know what, I've already tracked your number, and I'm recording this stuff. So, you know what, keep it up and the cops will have a nice little chat with you eventually. You know what? Have a nice day man.
(hang up)
(ring)
Thank you for calling Game Stop, where you can buy more with a PowerUp Rewards Credit Card, this is William speaking, how can I help you?
You ready to feel my frickin' grip? Once I come up 'ere?
I don't really care, how's that?
Straighten this out here.
Well, no, I think that there's some sort of issue with you, perhaps. Uh, maybe you should calm down a little bit? I don't think that you need to be making any sort of threats.
Well I got a copy of Halo, and this cartridge is all screwed up, every w...
I'm sorry, cartridge? Halo was never on a cartridge, I think you're confused.
Ah, you're gonna be confused once I come up 'ere and settle the score. How's that sound?
Settle the score about what? Seriously, what are you implying? Say it straight, don't play around now.
This defective Halo I got here.
So what is defective? You said a cartridge for Halo?
The score reads "oh,oh,oh,oh,oh" after I defeated everybody in sight.
Well, what does that have to do with us? That would be a software issue. If you're having an issue with your console, I would suggest calling Microsoft.
Is that clear enough for ya?
Ah, was my answer clear enough for you?
How about you feel my grip? How's that sound?
Sir, what does that mean? Do you have a problem holding something.
I'm gonna grip your lips.
Are you making a threat? Be a little more eloquent in what you're trying to say instead of making veiled threats.
I'm gonna wring your fricking neck, is what I'm gonna do.
Ok, then what we're gonna do, is we're gonna call the police right now, and there's gonna be a report filed against you. How's that one for you?
What do you mean by that?
Pschhh, I don't know, do you understand English? Does that not make sense you you, if we call the police and file a report against you, because you're making threats?
I'm gonna wring your fricking neck if you don't gimme what I need.
What, what is your problem?
I want triple my purchase price refunded to me today.
HA HA! I'm sorry, blackmail doesn't work buddy. We already know about you, we've heard. You called yesterday and pulled this stuff.
Just give me the manager there, tough guy.
I am the manager, so that's it, you're done. You hear me? You want to call and make threats? I am calling the police and filing a report, right now. You want to call back? I'll make sure that they're aware of it.
Don't do that.
Why wouldn't I do that? You just made a threat.
I'll come up and settle it one-on-one, there, smart guy.
Oh, no. Oh really? Is that what you're gonna do? Because fine, let me know when you're gonna be here, and I will have a police officer waiting for you.
I played Halo for 90 minutes and my score reads "oh oh oh"? This thing's defective.
You've already made threats which means that this conversation being civil, or us taking care of your problem, is done. It's null and void.
You're gonna feel my foot. That's the way it's gonna go down.
HA, HA, HA! I'm gonna feel your foot? Please, tell me when you'll be here, I'll have a police officer waiting, so that we can have this taken care of, so they can arrest you for making physical threats over the phone.
'Bout ten, fifteen minutes from now.
Ok. I'll be waiting here for you. I'll see you in fifteen minutes.
I'm gonna bring my joystick and wrap it around your fricking neck. Not a problem, not a problem at all.
You are absolutely hilariously idiotic.
Not a problem at all. I'll take care of you, and then I'll settle the score, is what I'm gonna do.
You'll settle what score? You've been messing this whole thing up the entire time. You're talking about Halo, and you talked about a cartridge. You can't keep your story straight, so...If you could give me a straight story, maybe I could've helped you, but instead you just resorted to making threats about hitting people.
I'm gonna pull your fricking teeth out, one by one. How's that sound tonight?
Uh, that sounds wonderful. Did you have any other, like, dentistry that you'd like to try to do on me today?
No, I think you'll be done after that, you'll be toasts.
I'll be toast, huh? You gonna put me in your toaster as well?
Why don't you shut your trap?
No, I'm sorry, you were the one who was trying to be smart with us, and hilarious. I'll leave my trap wide open at this point.
Just give me your manager.
I told you, I am the manager.
I don't believe you, first of all.
Well, too bad. (laughs) The truth is, I am the manager on duty, and I am the highest authority you can speak to right now, and in fact you're on speaker phone for the other people working in the store right now.
Ummmm. I'm gonna take my elbow to your ribcage, and then you'll be the lowest employee, when you're laying on the fricking ground.
Gosh, this has started off as something about a broken Halo game, and then you directly moved to making physical threats, when I told you that I didn't understand what the issue that you were talking about. You said it was reading "zero, zero, zero" across the board, that sounds like a software issue, which is not something that I would be able to help you with. In fact, I don't even know what you mean by that.
I'm gonna break your ribs. One by one. Until you give me triple my money back.
Until your impotent little threats stop, there's not gonna be actually anything that's happening.
Quit wasting my time.
No, I think that you're wasting my time, although you've made my day pretty hilarious.
Buddy, just put your regional manager on the phone.
There's not going to be any escalation, because this is how it works in the state of California. When you make a verbal threat, or you harass an employee of a store, we are no longer legally obligated to deal with your garbage. So if you call back, well actually it won't even matter, because when you do call back, it will be busy, because I'm going to have the phone off the hook, because I'm going to be talking to the police department, and I'm going to be filing a complaint against you. Trust me, when I hang up here, I'm gonna be calling the police department.
Yeah, you're gonna be in fantasy land, once I knock you out.
Oh my gosh. (laughs) The only reason why I'm continuing to talk to you is because I find it hilarious. But at this point, the same repetition of the same idiotic statements has gotten boring, so goodbye.

Hello?
Hi, I'm up at the food bank.
Uh-huh.
I'm supposed to ask if you can use a spork on turducken?
What's that?
Which one?
Who gave you my number?
A volunteer.
A volunteer...
Yeah!
...gave you a number? Uhhhhhhhhhh, I think you got the wrong number.
I'm Down 'N' Dirty Rufus.
I don't know who Down 'N' Dirty Rufus is.
Will you make a cash donation, please?
No, (unintelligible).
I'm Down 'N' Dirty Rufus.
I don't know who Down 'N' Dirty Rufus is.
It's Meeeeeeeee!
I don't know who you arrrrrrreeee.
I'm telling you right here (music plays briefly, call ends).
(Ring) NBS Electronics.
Yeah, you guys got pitch pipes up 'ere?
No, I don't sell that kind of stuff at all.
It's for a guitar.
Yeah, I understand what it is, this is an amp repair shop. I don't do that kind of stuff.
I play for Down 'N' Dirty Rufus and, uhh, we got a gig...
You know, if you think I don't recognize your voice, you're barking up the wrong tree, so why don't you just stick it up your ass.
It sounds like you're on a crack pipe.

(Male voice, Presumably Alex Trebek) Hello?
Hi, I'm Schlobo from Zatarain's rice.
I have no idea who you are and what you want. You want to tell me?
Zatarain's! The rice cooker.
I know nothing about it.
Real Spicy.
Well, sorry, I'm not interested.
But I have a note here to call ya.
Well, you couldn't have a note to call me because (beep) ask you to call me.
Uhhhh, Schlobo Nix.
No.
That's my name.
No.
Uhhh.
(Third female voice) Yes, hello? (This voice is not heard again on the call).
(Trebek) Yes, there ya go, that's the person you should be calling, I guess.
I'm sort of a phenom when it comes to cooking. Am I in the right place?
(Trebek) No, I didn't call you. So someone is screwing around with the phones I think.
Is there some sort of flip that needs to happen?
(Trebek) I...I have no idea, somebody has managed to jerk the phone system around so that two or three people are called at the same time and are told that they were calling somebody else. And it just...I wish I could explain it to you, but, somebody's having fun at our expense.
Well, what do you have to say about Zatarain's?
(Trebek) I don't know anything about it.
It's a spicy, uh, concoction. It's full of character.
(Trebek) Well, I don't care.
Real flavorful.

Thank you for calling the downtown Portland Shutterbug, this is Shawn, how may I help ya?
Shutterbug Shawn?
Yep.
This is Emilio. How you doing?
Not too bad.
Good.
What's going on, what can we help you with?
I'm looking to pixelate 35mm film.
So you wanna scan it?
No, just, you know, right outta the box. I got uh, an assignment to, uh, photograph the Little Miss Clackamas Pageant comin' up this weekend. So can you hel-
What was that?
I got assigned to Little Miss Clackamas, Shawn.
Mhm.
And I'm
the go to
photographer, I'm like, kinda,
the guy
. So...
Okay...Whaddya, what it, what are you looking, what are you, whaddya, whaddya, whaddya, so you're shooting this event so whaddya, what are you, what service are you looking for from us?
Well, it's Little Miss Clackamas.
Mhm.
I'm comin' outta Baker City, and one of the contestants, she's a lil gal named Britney. And she wants it to be filmed, but to be pixelated, and her mom's pretty adamant about the whole deal.
Well, I don't...what you could do is, you know, you could get it digitized, um, when you get it developed, just get it put to a CD. If you want it...look like pixelized, you could just lower the resolution.
We're talkin' about
film
, here, fella!
That's what I said, was, at the time of development you can get it scanned to a CD.
Shawn, maybe you didn't hear me the first time around, but we're talkin' Little Miss Clackamas, here. It's kind of a big deal.
Well, I'm, you know, you want it to look pixelized, you know, that's one of doing it. Scanning the film and to make it digital. If that's what you're looking to do.
Have you ever been to Little Miss Clackamas?
I'm sorry, I have not.
Well, there's a four year old flautist out there by the name of Sally May. She plays the flute like somebody four times her age. Oh, she's phenomenal. She also happens to be 210 pounds. It's just a special event, all the way around.
Okay, I'm not quite understanding what, what, what you're, what services that you're wanting. I'm not, I'm kinda confused on, you know, I, what, what, what, what, what you're interested in doing.
Wel-
I understand that you're shooting Little Miss Clackamas. You know, we're a photography store, and you wanna do it on film. And I understand that you want it to look pixelated. My idea was to convert it to film. Does that sound like in the ballpark of what you wanna do?
Yeah, and I was hoping maybe you could, maybe look into my mouth. I feel like I have something stuck in teeth, and I, there's nobody else around, my neighbors are all outta town.
I-I, I'm sorry, I-I, I-I don't understand what you're wanting us to do. You know, this is an odd...You're just, like, wha-, I-I don't understand the conversation. Just, like, that I understand that you're shooting Miss, Little Miss Clackamas. And the first thing you said, that you're shooting on film and you want it to look pixelated, and, and that was my solution. You know, does that sound right that you want it, that digitizing it to make it look pixelized would work for you?
But I've got the sensation as if there's something stuck in my teeth, and would you consider looking in my mouth? Maybe with a high resolution photography machine?
I-I wouldn't, I don't do that. You might wanna go to a dentist to, to, to accomplish that. That has the equipment for inner oral photography.
But it's Little Miss Clackamas...sir.
I'm, I'm sorry, sir, this conversation is very uncomfortable and I'm going to hang up.
What part do you need me to go over again?
Okay, I'm, I'm a photography store, what, what are you looking for from...from us? Do you need film? You said you're shooting film. I have Portra 100, I have, Port, er, Portra 400, 160, 800, that would be great to shoot Miss...Little Miss Clackamas.
So, I understand. So, you're lookin' for free tickets, for comped tickets-
I'm-
to Little Miss Clackamas.
I'm not, I'm not looking, I'm, you called me to ask me about photograph stuff for your ability to shoot Little Miss Clackamas.
And you're lookin' for free tickets, is that it? Well, you know, I-
I-I, I'm not, I'm not looking for tic-Um, sir?
Yes?
I have a customer that just walked in the door, um, you know, if you come in, we can...discuss...whatever...services that you need, um, that we might provide. Our store just got filled up, I need to help other customers that are in the store.
Okay, would like me to take a peek inside
your
mouth?
No, I would not.
Well, do you need time to think about it? I mean, I've got till tomorro-
No, I-I, I don't, I'm sorry, sir. I don't need time to think about that.
Well, I have-
I-I-I have, I have to go, I have other customers to help.

Thank you for calling the Shutterbug in downtown Portland, this is Shawn, how may I help ya?
Hi, Shawn, yeah, I spoke to ya and boy I'm havin' a heck of a time gettin' that pixelated effect, here, with my 35mm film. So, could you work with me on that one, just a, just a skosh?
Well, if you want to accomplish a pixelated image, you gonna have to get your filmed scanned to digital.
I'm live at an event, you know, I got stuff to pixelate up here.
Well, to make it a pixelated look, you're gonna have to do that in post-processing. Just shoot your event, then when you get done, get it scanned to digital because pixelation is not a term that you use for film. You use the term "graininess" for film and that, if you wanted a grainy look, you'd use a high speed film. If you wanted pixelated, it's a similar thing, but it's mainly when you consider something low resolution. It like, makes it kind of cubular, because a pixel is square, not circular. Where grain is kinda circular, but not really, it's just, uh, the texture of silver particles in the film.
Okay, now, as I said, I've got this strong sensation in my gum line, uh, that I've got something stuck in my teeth. Now, where do you stand on that?
I'm, I'm sorry I'm not going this direction again, sir. If you want to talk to one of my other sales associates, I'm glad to pass you onto them, but I'm not a dentist, I have nothing to do with that.
Just take a look, tell me whatcha see.
That's not my business. And you're not in front of me, so I couldn't do that anyways. But I'm sorry.
Just speculate, then.
I'm, I'm not gonna speculate on the health of your gums. I'm, I'm sorry, sir, I'm not.
Listen, I don't think you recognize what's at stake for these little gals out here.
I'm sorry, sir, um...we could further this discussion if you wanna come in. We can figure out how to pixelate your film, but I'm not a board certified dentist, I'm sorry.
How 'bout I pixelate your teeth a couple times, here. Left middle left!
Okay, I'm gonna end the conversation here. I'm sorry, you have a good day.

[ring]
Thank you for calling the downtown Portland Shutterbug, this is Shawn, how may I help ya?
Shawn, fella, I'm tryin' to work with ya. But we've got a live event, here, and this film just ain't pixelatin'...buddy. Hah!
I'm sorry, you can come in and we can figure out exactly what you want, but I don't think there's...Youuuu...I'm either not understanding you or you're definitely not understanding me. I went to college for photography, so I know what pixelation means. You know, it's like...
that's
my suggestion and that's all I know what to tell you. And I know nothing about Little Miss Clackamas.
You're not gonna know where your teeth are when I'm done with ye.
I, you know, I don't appreciate you being...vulgar to me. You know, you don't have to say something like that, you know?
Like what?
What you just [laughs]
You've made it clear you don't care about the contestants here at Little Miss Clackamas, you've made that abundantly clear!
You're trying to pixelate something, it's a, you're shooting film and so want to digitize it to make a pixelated look. That's my suggestion.
What if I took, uh, the palm of my hand...and just shoved it right into your chin bone?
I'm, sir, I am ending the conversation right now. You just threatened me.
Oh, come on!
I'm not, I'm ending the conversation.
I've gone to college, and I graduated.

My name's Bud Studdard, I'm a customer.
Ok, ok what can I do for you?
Yeah, I got some wipers up there, guy, last week. And uh, my car is messed up as a result. I got some big problems up 'ere. You guys warranty your work?
I really don't understand what you're trying to say.
(Sound effects) Oh, I got some windshield wipers, and then I left the place, and then I pulled a PIT maneuver at the dump, later in the day. And my car is fouled up (pitch shift) something fierce. I can't even believe it. I can't see anything. Ohhhhh(sound effects).
Yeah, well maybe if you get your head out of your ass, you might be able to see it.
Huh? You guys don't warranty your work up 'ere?
Well, you didn't get any fucking shit from me, pal.
What are you trying to say? I got my receipt somewhere around here.
And you got a pair of wiper blades from me?
(Sound effects) Yes i did.
Are you a faggot boy? Are you a little fucking faggot boy?
Your work ain't done right. I can guarantee you that nothing was done right.
I can guarantee you're a little faggot. You probably suck dick, don't you?
I went to the dump, and I pulled a PIT maneuver, and now I got odors coming out. My differential is (sound effect) fouled up. And I don't know what I need to do. Ohhhhh. (sound effects).
You really need to take your money and buy something that's worth a fuck, 'cause you're a fucking idiot.
Why don't you give me a refund? And then I'll...
Why don't you come over here and try to get a refund? If you think you're that big of a fucking boy, why don't you come up here? Because I think you're a pussy.
I'll come up 'ere and succeed. Is what I intend to do.
Bring all your little fucking boys, and come up and do it.

Hey, my differential's fouled up, guy.

Hey, yeah, you guys stand by your work up there?
Y'know, I can't hear you.
I'm saying, do you guys give warranties on your work?
Y'know what, you sound like you've got a dick in your mouth.
Okay, well, that's unprofessional. Strikingly unprofessional.
Yeah, well, calling here five times in a fuckin' row and playin' games is not very professional, either.
Hey, you gave me defective wipers there, tough guy, and I want a refund.
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. I got- I got a lot of people here listening, and it's kinda funny, because you know what? We recognize who you are. So why don't you continue?
(Pitch shift, echo) Oh no
Have you ever pulled a PIT maneuver at the dump?
By the way, you know what's also funny is your burner app - y'know, so you got these burner fuckin' phone numbers - is really fuckin' traceable. You're a fuckin' idiot.
(Echo) What are you tryin' to say?
You are so much of a fuckin' idiot. You think we can't trace where the fuckin' burner numbers are comin' from and then who's got that? Are you that fuckin' stupid? You think you just get a fuckin' app and get any fuckin' phone number you want - use any phone number you want - and it's not traceable? Y'know, the fuckin' sheriff's already been here and- and got everything, got all the fuckin' recordings, dude.
(Pitch shift) Ooh, is that so?
[unintelligible] Because I don't really care. I own this fuckin' company, and I own two other fuckin' companies, and y'know what? You're a piece of shit, and they're gonna fuckin' go after you for harassment. So you keep callin' here, 'cause I got all fuckin' day, and I got over twenty employees-

Mind if I use the toilet up 'ere, real quick?
So you're a faggot?!
Gonna hop on the toilet, and then I'll take off. (Pitch shift) Oh
Are you in the toilet? You sound like you're in the toilet.
I'm nearby, and, uh, I'd consider it a big favor.

You got a dick in your mouth?
(Pitch shift) I don't make sense to ya, or-? Buddy, lemme just use the toilet.
Yeah, I heard you like sailor boys. I heard you like to be on a ship and- and get fucked in the ass with the sailor boys. Is that true?
I just need to borrow your toilet. You don't need to be sarcastic. (Pitch shift) Skip the sarcasm.
No, I'm bein' sarcastic 'cause you sound like a little fuckin' faggot boy. Sound like a little faggot boy from down South, there. Are you?
(Pitch shift) Just skip the sarcasm there, guy.
I got sarcasm all fuckin' day long. I'm a rich dude. That's what I get paid to do, is be fuckin' sarcastic.
I'm gonna swing a bullwhip up 'ere.
Why don't you come and do it if you think you can? Is that what sailors do, is they get on their little fuckin' boats 'cause they're little fuckin' faggots?
(Pitch shift, echo) I'm gonna whoop ya in the ass!
Real men become Marines or somethin' like that. Only faggots become sailors. You ain't gon' whip nothin'. Y'know, you think you're so fuckin' cool with your burner app, you're [fuckin' callin' these numbers.]? It's so easy to fuckin' block you all the fuckin' time.

Wholesale Icons (?)
Yeah, I'm Camacho. And I'm looking to to sell, uh, a comic book.
Ok.
I've got the, uh, KISS comic book. The comic was printed with real LSD, so it's real valuable.
Uhhh, I don't have a need for that.
Well I didn't ask you if you needed it. You're gonna buy it for somebody else to buy.
I don't want to buy it, that's what I'm saying.
I thought this was a comic book store.
It is, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna buy every comic book, and I don't need that one.
Definitely need it, and I'm lookin' to get money on it, don't you understand that?
I understand what you're saying, but I don't want to buy it.
What's the trouble up 'ere?
I said, I don't want the book.
You need to sell it to somebody else.
Yeah, but I don't have someone who wants it, so I don't want to buy it.
You got all kinds of people looking for this thing. This thing was printed with LSD, fella. (echo sound effects).
I don't want it.
You gotta have it. I'm telling you right now.
I don't want it though.
I've got it, it's in mint condition, it's sealed. I mean I lick it, once or twice a year.
Then I definitely don't want it.
Why? (echo)
You just said you licked it, that means it's not worth as much.
Look, thing has got LSD in it.
Yes, I know, and that's an illegal drug. So why would I want something here like that.
KISS.
Yeah, that's nice, I just don't want it.
The demons of rock. The demons of rock.
I, I know. And I'm telling you, I don't want that book.
Why? (echo) Come on, you gotta (weird sound effects).
I don't know what you're doing with your phone here. I don't want...
...Look, I'm gonna come up there, and I'm...
No, don't bother, I'm not gonna buy it.
This is KISS.
I don't care if it's KISS. I said I don't want it.
From the 1970's. The demons of rock.
I know what it is, I don't want it.
I didn't ask if YOU wanted it...
My store doesn't need it.
You gotta have it in stock...
I DON'T WANT IT!
(echoey) You don't even know what you need, or have or what you don't have. You gotta get this thing in stock...
And I don't want it.
(Echoey) You've gotta know what you have before you get it...
Listen, stop trying to sell it to me. I don't want it. You can call someone else, so...
I'm gonna come up there, I'm...
No, don't even bother coming up here, I don't want it.
Just pay me what I need, and then...
I don't need to pay anything, I don't want to buy it.
KISS. (echoey)
I don't care if it's KISS. Listen, don;t bother calling here again, I'm hanging up now.
Listen, I'm gonna bring this comic book in there, and you're gonna love what you see. I guarantee it.
Look, look, I don't want this book.
Look, I'll let you lick the thing, and you can see for yourself.
NO! I don't even want to do that.
Look, just lick it, and then make your decision.
NO! No, I'm gonna be calling the cops anyways, if you keep harassing me...
I'm coming up there, I'm coming up there. Don't worry about it.
I don't want it!
It'll be fine.
No, and I'm gonna call the cops and let them know all about this.
Will you just lick the thing...
NO!
...and tell me what you think?
No, I don't want to lick it. I don't want to it.
Come on, just check it out.
NO!
It's KISS, the demons of rock. Do you understand? (Sound effects until hang up)
No!
You're gonna love it, this thing is off the chain.

Hi. I want to get some nostril and some snout lined up for tonight. Ten, fifteen pounds?
We don't sell any of that brother.
Ohhhhhhhh. I need lips and snout and nose.
Pig lips?
Yeah.
Yeah, we don't, we don't sell that, my man. Just turkey necks, turkey wings, chicken leg quarters. We don't sell that.
Gimme some legs and some tail. Alright? Fifteen, twenty pounds will be good. (sound effects) For tonight. I got a cook out tonight.
Okay, uhhh, well come check us out, man.
Oh, I've been there man, I've been there...before.
Okay...
How much you charge for half a calf?
Half a calf? (presumably to coworkers) Half a calf? Half a calf?

Hello.
Yeah, what's up?
Oh, this is Jacoby.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I needed to get some lips, some snout and nostril, some tails. Just fifteen pounds, maybe twenty pounds for tonight. Got a cook-out.
Nah, I don't think I have that much right now, I only get that at the beginning of the month.
Maybe five pounds? Ten pounds?
Uh, I don't have none of that right now.
How about mucus? Bacteria? Anything that you could put in a cup.
No brother, none of that.

Stephen speaking.
(sound effects) Ohhhhhh yeeeeeahhhhh. (SFX end) Hi, could I get a few ounces of tendon, for tonight?
I don't know that I actually have any in stock at the moment. I'll be right back.
I do need a few ounces of urine, too. And blood.
Uhh, tendon we could do, but the rest unfortunately we couldn't do. It's just not something that we carry.
Full disclosure, I, I'd probably accept some of your own urine.
Oh, some of my own? No, unfortunately I don't give away my own urine. That's my own policy. It'd be like a conflict of interest really, working in a place that, you know, sells that kind of stuff. Yeah, I just wouldn't feel right giving that away.
I'd insist on paying you something for your time, and for your, and of course for your urine.
Yeah, no, no, I definitely understand that. Yeah, no but unfortunately It's just not something that I'd be willing to do. I'd have to check with my wife, too, and yeah, you know, that doesn't always go so well.
Maybe after hours, I could meet you outside in the back, and just pick it up?
Yeah, but that feels kind of sketchy, giving my urine away to somebody after hours. It just doesn't seem right.
I'm a good Christian, I assure you.
Yeah, no, no, I fully understand dude. If you're a good Christian and all. But I'm an atheist, so that really doesn't matter much to me.
The flavor profile of the urination...
Ohhh.
...is just something I prefer.
But, you know, you don't know what my diet's like, so it might not be something you would enjoy.
I know, but you're in the business, so I,I assume it would be preferable to my own.
Yeah, but I'm vegetarian, though.
So, let me just get some blood, and urine, like I say. Any source you can get it from, and the tendon, I can be there for tonight? Sound good?
Yeah, tell you what, we'll meet you after, and we'll see what we can figure out for ya.
Ok, yeah (crazy echo effects)
(SFX continue) Alright. (SFX end)
Take care.
You too.

Radio Shack in Grosse Pointe, can I help you?
Uh, looking to get a tripler. I'm looking to scale down from my quadrupler. But I've got two couplers going on my signal, and a flipper. I'm just trying to condense that into one tripler, maybe two couplers and a flipper, just to condense it.
Ah???
So, do you all accept coupons?
I mean, if it's something through Radio Shack, I'm sure they'd be able to, like maybe, add something from a Radio Shack web site or something.
Yeah.
(Unintelligible) ...pretty sure if they have what's available, they should be able to do something with the price for you. Whatever you have, just bring it in, and we can get that matched up for you.
Just bring all my quadruplers in there?
Well, I mean your coupon, I was saying, if you want to see if we can give you money, uh, to match with the coupon, if they are going to give you any money off, I would say bring whatever paper you have, as far as coupons.
Yeah, just give me the money, give me the funds, maybe I can run somewhere else and pick up what I need. So you'll just have the money ready?
(hang up sound)
(ring)
Grosse Pointe Radio Shack, this is Garrett, how can I help you?
Yeah, uh, Garrett what's the limit on the number of couplers I can have when I'm quadrupling my signal?
I don't even know.
I got a rubber, running through a flipper that I'm trying to quadruple, but all I've got are triplers. And I do have a couple couplers. But I'm trying to scale down, and, you know, I don't have a lot of money either, so I'm budget conscious too. Is there a coupon, or something I can apply toward this?
I mean, the couplers are cheap. How much is a coupler? Do you know what kind of coupler you need?
Uh, a rubber.
A rubber coupler?? What's the couplers for?
Uh, for my flipper.
Flipper? What does it do?
I've got a tripler on it, for my signal, but, I'm really trying to quadruple it. So, i've got, uh, rubber with a tripler and the two couplers, to reverse my adaptor, basically. So I'm trying to multiply my couplers, into my rubber.
To be honest, I have no idea.
Uh...
I could not tell you, I'm not gonna make something up.
You can tell me, I mean...
Uhhhh...Pssst. I don't even...what does the flipper do? I don't even...pssst.
Well, my rubber.
Ok, maybe my co-worker can help you, 'cause I'm not going to be able to help you.
Well, if it's proprietary, I won't share the information.
(new Radio Shack employee voice) Hello?
Hi
Yeah?
What's going on here?
Uhh, what kind of coupler are you looking for, sir? We have couplers for co-ax, and we have couplers for HDMI.
Sure. Well, I'm trying to quadruple my signal, er, and all I've got's a tripler and a couple couplers. My flipper is joined with my multiplier and my rubber. So, uh, how many multipliers can I fit with my divider, before I have to get just a joiner?
I mean, you could go, you can go the max. Like if you can put all your connections together at once...
Yeah.
...Then you can go the max. And we have, uh, three-way splitters, I think we may even have a four-way splitter.
Okay, but my tripler is gonna end up multiplying my coupler, you understand? So my signal will be coupled with the flipper. And plus, my coupon...
What is the coupon for?
I don't know if you're sticklers. 'Cause it may have been expired. Actually, there's no year on it, it just says the date of the month and the day. Essentially, so I'm tripling my rubber. My signal's quadrupled, but I'm tryin' to run my subtractor through the coupler, so that my flipper can adapt to the reverser. And the coupon, I don't know if you're a stickler.
Umm, yeah, the coupon ends on the 25th and it doesn't have like a valid end date?
Yeah.
Yeah, it may be expired by now. Because the coupon, I'm pretty sure, that expired.
Uh, would you need to feel my rubber, so that you could best advise which trickler to use?
Ummmm, I don't know.
So if you're flippin' my rubber, and my trickler's gonna multiply the divider, my signal'd be reversed down to the basic coupler, to that stage.
Yeah, I mean, when (unintelligible, perhaps "whizzing past"?) the coupler, and the dividers and multiplier's just goin' all nuts, and your rubber's goin' crazy?
Yeah. Maybe somebody could come over and take a gander?
Uhh, no, no, we can't send anybody out to check out your rubber.
Oh, okay. Would you please talk to The Gargler, and maybe he could better explain it, 'cause I, I, you know.
(Ring)
(Arthur The Gargler) What do you need?

We got a quadrupler on sale that multiplies our coupler with no tripler.
(Arthur) Well that's okay, because uh, we got all that stuff. Don't hang up on me, 'cause you're talking to one of the big boys from Hollywood, and we got all that stuff.
Oh.
(Ring)
(Arthur) Well you son of a bitch.
(Radio Shack) Grosse Center Radio Shack, this is Garrett, how can I help you?
(LPC) Yeah, I was calling about that tripler.
(Radio Shack) Oh, yeah.
(LPC) And you were gonna talk to the gargler. Would that be okay? Just real quick?
(Radio Shack) Okay.
(LPC) Okay, Arthur? (ring) Just let him know you talked to me.
(Arthur) Crime desk, we got cut off. Your phone must've hung up on me. Now what do you need? Do you speak English?
(Radio Shack) Yes, I speak English.
(Arthur) Well, damnit you're having a hell of a time about it. What do you need? I got time, now this is a crime desk here, and I tried to talk to the guy on the phone, and he hung up on me. Now what do you actually need? And I spent a lot of time at your, at your place.
(Radio Shack) Uh, to be honest sir, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not sure what...I don't know, I can't tell you.
(Arthur) (Laughs) I even just got done, um, getting my new printer from yous up there. We spent a lot of money from you, because we're in Hollywood, and uh, I was just talking to your boys over there, and (Unintelligible) mostly all my money up there with yas.
(Radio Shack) Hmm.
(Arthur) So what did he call me for?
(Radio Shack) Called you?
(Arthur) He called me two times in a row.
(Radio Shack) He called the Radio Shack.
(Arthur) This is Art Schattner.
(Radio Shack) He said he has a flipper, and he needs to know how many couplers he can put on his flipper. And he wants someone to go by his house, and we cannot do that.
(Arthur) Like I told you, I'm a Goddamn cop. Bunch of fucking phoney calls coming in.
(Hang up sound)
(Radio Shack) Excuse me?
(LPC) The tripler. Now, where do you stand?
(Radio Shack) I'm sorry sir, we cannot help you. This is, we, I, I'm not sure what you're talking about. This is- yeah, we, we can't help you.
(LPC) What do you mean?
(Radio Shack) What do you, I mean we're not sure what you're talking about. I don't know if this is some prank, but we cannot help you. I'm sorry, I'm hanging up.
(LPC) A prank?
(hang up sound)
(ring)
(Radio shack) (laughing) - Grosse Pointe Radio Shack, this is Wes speaking.
(LPC) Okay, would you please talk to The Gargler? I was having a hard time explaining what I need.
(Radio Shack) With your tripler?
(LPC) Yeah.
(Radio Shack) Was your tripler giving you problems with the triple double axle?
(LPC) The quadrupler is where I was running...
(Radio Shack) The quadrupler?
(LPC) Huh?
(Radio Shack) Is the quadrupler dripping?
(LPC) Can you talk to The Gargler? He can explain it much better, if you'd just give me a minute.
(Radio shack) All that you need to tell me is if there's a leak. I need to know if there's a leak. I can't help you, unless there's a leak.
(LPC) Well he'll tell you, just talk to Arthur.
(Ring)
(Radio Shack) Okay, put Arthur on the phone.
(Arthur) Crime Desk, what do you need?
(Radio Shack) I need to know if it's leaking.
(Arthur) What the hell are you talking about? Are you on drugs or dope?
(Radio Shack) Dope is drugs.
(Arthur) Yeah, I know, you're a sick, cocksucking, motherfucker.
(hangup sound)
(Radio Shack) But is it leaking?
(LPC) Sir, you're not helping. I'm trying to get my tripler going, it's stopping at the point of the quadrupler. Alright?
(Radio Shack) Okay. I,I,I, is your rubber leaking the signal?
(LPC) I'm in the car, I could be there in 20 minutes. Like, would you please talk to The Gargler? Just tell him what I told you, and I'll know what to buy when I get there, okay?
(ring)
(Radio Shack) No, I can already tell you that we don't have the part you're looking for.
Sigh)
(Arthur) Hey horse's ass, what do you want? Why don't you go fuck your mother, you ain't got nothing else to do.
(Radio Shack) You might be better off calling Best Buy.
Best Buy?
(Radio Shack) Yeah.
I've already made the expenditure with you all.
(Radio Shack) Well, no. Because your coupon isn't valid, and we don't have the part you need.
Well tell Arthur that, he's The Gargler, you know?
(Radio Shack) (Sigh) Alright, can I speak to Arthur The Gargler?
Yes.
(Ring).
(Arthur) Hey Brown? I got all day to cut you off, now what do you want?
(Radio Shack) Hello?
(Arthur) Yeah?
(Radio Shack) Okay, we don't have the parts you need, to stop the leak in your rubber, 'cause your gargler is, uh, acting up. so...
(Arthur) Does your mothe...Does your father fuck your mother in the ass, like you was born, you mother fucker cock of a son of a bitch?
(hang up)
(Unknown voice) Oh, that's not nice sir.

(ring) Hello? Hello?
Yes, Hello. This is Juan Friend with United Parcel Service.
Yeah?
We've been trying to come through, sir, for several days, and no one answered the door.
Oh. Ok, I mean there's somebody home. We were probably out in back.
Oh, in back, huh? So you guys don't have a functional doorbell? (sound effects) What's a good time, sir, to come by? This will be the third attempt now.
Uhhhh, are you in the area today?
I'm on McHardy(?) Road, currently. I got seven or eight stops, I could be there between eight and nine PM.
Sure. This is UPS?
Yes sir. Juan Friend is my name. I'm a driver. It's from Historical Hair, the parcel.
And what's the address you have?
Historical Hair, they do period piece wigs from all different points...in time. (sound effects) Ok?
Yeah, I duh, I duh, I, I never ordered nothin'.
I deliver for them all the time, actually. Maybe you're not much of a history buff, but they do all kinds of historical wigs, all kinds of things. (sound effects). Ok, so you're gonna be there about nine, ten PM?
No I'm not!
You're not now.
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE! I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
What seems to be the trouble up 'ere? (sound effects)
What was that?
This will be our fourth attempt, sir. We're trying to get this delivered for ya.
Uh, let me, uh, is this a good number to call you at?
I'm behind the steering wheel right now, guy. I'm trying to help ya. This is actually my day off, our driver's sick today, so I had to lend a hand.
You know something?
What's that?
Uh, why don't you take one hand off the wheel...
Yeah.
...and shove a finger up your ass.
Hey, Historical Hair, they're friends of mine.
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! I'm turning your number over to the state police!
Hey, guy. Leo is it?
No. No.
Ok.
You understand me? I'm giving this number - I'm calling the state police as soon as I get done talking to you, and I'm giving them your number.
(sound effects) Whoa...about history, if you don't know anything about history, you wouldn't know historic hair. They do all kinds wigs, and powdered wigs, it's real neat. Why don't ya check it out, instead of being so unprofessional.
No.
You're unprofessional...(ya just are)
Hey, Hey, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself.
You're unprofessssssssss...Am I understoodddddddd?
(hang up sound)
(ring)
Hello?
Yes, I'm Brent Friend, I'm a statewide manager at UPS.
Well this is somebody else, now.
We have a package from Historical Hair for ya. We're tryin' to deliver it today. What's the problem up there, sir?
What's your problem?!? What, uh, uh, UPS when they come here, they drop a tag off at the door if there's nobody home. Now, I don't know what kind of scam you're running. I told your friend I'm gonna turn these numbers over to the state police.
(pitch shifted and echo) What? What?...We have Historical Hair, parcel of historic wigs, that you ordered...
Na, ah, I didn't order nothin'. Let me talk to your supervisor.
Ok, one moment.
(ring sound, LPC voice is not present from now until next ring sound. This is an unknown 3rd voice (LPCs "supervisor"), speaking with the original call recipient which LPC is trying to deliver Historic Hair to)
(third voice) Hello?
Who is this?
Hellooo?
Hello?
Yeah. Helloooo.
What's your name?
If you don't know my name you wouldn't be calling here. (breathing sounds) Why don't you speak up, you prick?
You show up at my house, I'm calling the police department. Do you understand that?
(hang up sond)
(ring sound)
Hello?
(LPC) Hi, my name's Juan Friend, I got a lot of Historical Hair, wigs, Civil War, all kinds of period pieces I'm trying to get rid of.
Uh, yeah, you'd have to call the pawn shop for that. We'd probably schedule you for it, OK?
Ah, nice. I got a twenty foot long wig, actually. It was mean for like a Crystal Gayle type...
(hang up sound)
(ring)
Hello?
(LPC) Hey, what's the big idea up 'ere? (pitch shifted down at end).
Ok, dude, you know, you know, I'm with my kids right now, I'm with my kids. (sound effects) Ok, so obviously, obviously you, how old are you?
Me? I'm 22 sir.
So, do you live with your parents?
I live with my great grandmother. She's 109. (echo). That's how old she is. (echo). She turned me on to some of this wig stuff. She gave me a 20 foot wig, a Civil War wig...
Ok, so, so , this is what you do with your life?
Uh...
So obviously you don't have a job, either.
I don't wear wigs, I'm trying to sell them, i guess you...
So you don't have a job, ok. And you prank phone call people and think it's funny when you're 22 years old. I'm just saying dude, do you see a problem with that?
I need money, is that...
Do you?
Yeah, I need these wigs sold, like, yesterday.
Ok, so, so, you really, I mean dude. I mean just think about it.
Ok. (echo sound effects).
I mean, think about how really super cool you're acting right now. I mean, I mean, how, I mean it's so cool that you can prank phone call somebody, and be funny.
Well how.. ("how" echos)
You know, I mean dude, I mean.
Well how.. ("how" echos)
You know, I mean dude, I mean.
How much can I expect to make here? Monetarily? (echo).
You know dude, I mean it's ummm, obviously you got a lot of growing up to do. I mean really dude, I mean sit back and look at your life. Right now you could probably be out trying to get a job or something like that.
Crystal Gayle, I mean there's some Crystal Gayle Halloween fanatics out there that would love this 20 foot wig.
Well, no, think, think about it dude. Think about it. You're 22 years old and you're trying to make a prank phone call, to sound cool.
I got wigs up the yin yang, guy. That's what you don't seem to comprehend here.
No, I completely comprehend. I understand that you're a young guy, who has probably grown up without a father, or something like that, because you have, umm...You know he would have probably taught you that this was a stupid thing to do.
Ahh, I see what you're sayin'.
Ok, you know, it's not cool, really, to call up people and fuck with their lives. You, you, it's not.
You want to talk to my grandmother (pitch shifted down at end).
I'm, I'm with, I'm with, I'm with my young kids and my grandkids right now. K? And you're calling me up and wanting to make a joke of your day over me.
I've got historical hair, I've got 20 foot wigs, I've got everything ya neeeeed. I've got everything ya neeeeed. (Whole line is pitch shifted).
So, so, so wh, K, I just wanna, so what does this do for you? I wanna know.
I'm looking to make some money today. I need it like yesterday.
No, no, I want to know what this does for you? Making the prank phone calls. What does it do for you dude? What does it do for you? What does it do for you? What does it do for you?
(LPC repeating, with voice effects and echo) What does it do, it do, it do, it do...
What does it do for you?
(LPC making "what does it do" sound effects, these continue through to the hangup sound).
So you can't even answer the question. Because you're just an immature kid, who probably grew up without a dad, and, umm, and your just uh, you're lost in the world. K, so, dude, my suggestion is, dude, go get a job, and then maybe, maybe get an apartment...
(LPC sound effects: "de-doo, de-doo, de-doo).
(Hangup sound)
(ring)
Hello?
(LPC) Yeah, this is Brent, United Parcel Service. I'm trying to schedule a delivery up 'ere.
What kind of delivery?
Ah, from Historical Hair. They got all kinds of wigs from the Civil War, this era, that, or all kinds of different wigs.
Well I don't want none of them wigs. What do I want a wig for? I never purchased no wig.
Yes, ya did.
No, I didn't.
Well, I'm in the truck, I'm on my way up 'ere right now.
Pst, well come on up, but I didn't purchase no wig.
Well, it's C.O.D.
Well...I ain't got no cash. I've had this call a million times. I'm out workin' on my hot rod, I'll be right in the driveway.
Ok, well just give me the credit card number and uh...
Hah, I ain't givin' you no credit card number. You must think I'm stupid.
Hey, It's none of my business if you order wigs, or figs, or twigs, I don't care what you order.
So don't even bring 'er up, 'cause I ain't givin' you no credit card number, no nothin'.
Well I'm not coming up there without a credit card payment. Just read it to me now. (pitch shifting throughout line)
Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Dash, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Dash Zero...
(LPC repeating 'Zero' with effects and echo) Ron, just gimme what I neeed, gimme the information I neeeeed.
Ah, I'm givin' you nothing, and I don't need no wig, or whatever you're bringing up. Figs, or whatever it is, I didn't order it.
Historic Hair. They got wigs from the Civil War. The Elizabethan Era. They got wigs from everywhere. Everywhere. (echo and pitch effects).
Ha.
Give me the information that I neeeed. I need the long number for your credit card, and then I'll be up there with your merchandise. Ok? (effects throughout).
I don't want , no, no, Ha. (mocking the LPC echo effect) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why are you causing a problem for me? I never ordered nothing.
For you???? (echo) What do you mean for you? (echo).
(mocking LPC echo) Yooouuu keeeep that wiiigggy, wiiigy, wiiiggggy, wigggy, wiiiggggy, wiiiggggy, wiiiggggy, wiiiggggy, Good bye.
(hang up sound)
track end.
(Ring)
Hello?
(LPC Sound effects persist throughout call). Yeah? You there?
(Unintelligible, perhaps “Yes, sir.”)
Yeah, this is Wilder, your neighbor.
Next door to us?
Yeah, I feel that there’s been an exceeding amount of commotion coming out of there.
We haven’t been there today.
Well, I meant at night, there fella. And I’ve heard just about enough, if you want to know the God’s honest truth. (SFX)
Wha, wha, what neighbor are you talking about there, fella?
So, what can we do about it now, ‘cause I’ve heard enough, my family’s heard enough, and I’ve had visitors who’ve heard enough. Enough is enough, is what I’m trying to say.
Well which neighbor do you have?
I’m your neighbor there, smart man. And I’d like to resolve this.
You talking about on Eve Street, right?
Oh (SFX) exactly. Now, what do you propose to do up ‘ere?
(Unintelligible) Well, I could come out and talk to ya.
I’ve heard enough, why don’t you…
…Do what?
I’ve heard enough, there fella. And I’ve heard enough from you and your dogs and your cats and your birds. I just have.
We, we just put the dogs up.
Well you should do it a little earlier in the day, there fella.
Earlier?!?
Yeah!
This just don’t make sense. Now, you’re talking about the ones that just moved in, across the street, right?
Buddy, you’re not making a lick of sense up ‘ere. (SFX) So I would like to have you pipe down, put your dogs away, turn your TV down, and just bring it down a notch.
Look, I can bring it down, but the dogs don’t even bark. One of them don’t even have a barker on him anymore.
Ah, that’s malarkey.
Malarkey?!?
Yeah! (SFX).
Just who are you, guy?
I’m Wilder.
Like Van Wilder?
Ohhhh, I don’t know is that some kind of jibber-jabber, or something? (SFX)
What’s that in the background? Is that somebody else you got over there playing too?
That’s coming from your end, there.
My end's right over here. I'm in my yard, guy.
I heard a flute, I heard some kind of kettle drums. I heard everything from you.
We sold our kettle drums at the last yard sale. Who is this?
Why don't you just listen up? Get a cotton swab or do some cotton-pickin' thing, 'cause I've said it two, three times now. (SFX)
[unintelligible] I'm just tryin' to get your angle here, fella.
Who do you work for, anyhow? (Echo) Who do you work for, and who are you?
Wiley Sanders' Truck and who's askin'?
What are you tryin' to prove, is what I want to know. With all this commotion - you got sounds here and there, and everywhere. (SFX) I can't make out what your objective is here, as a matter of fact.
It's doin' it again, there's somethin' in the background.
(SFX) At your place?
Yeah.
What do you got, like a Komodo dragon or somethin' movin' around? (SFX)
(Laugh) We have two fish, three dogs, and a cat that's on its last legs here.
Well, be quiet, and put your kettle drum away. (SFX)
It's doin' it again. Do you hear it on your end, 'cause I'm gettin' some feedback.
I've got ringin' in my ears from all the noise and anarchy that you've got at your house.
I'm not with the Commie bullshit, cut it. You're startin' to cut too deep.
I'm gonna call the district attorney, ya read me? Do you read me? (SFX)
I read you. Don't call nobody, don't call no attorney. We can figure this out, we don't have to get nobody involved.
Why don't you stand out in your yard, (SFX) have a couple hundred-dollar bills handy so that I can get a motel room, and then I'll call it good. Y'know what I mean?
I'm walkin' out there now, where ya at? Where ya goin'? Ya comin' down Eve Street right now?
I'm on the toilet right now, but I'm gonna come out there and I'm gonna straighten it out with ya, ya got me? (SFX)
Did you just say you were on the shitter, guy?
200 dollars and then I'll resolve it with ya, but less than that, I'm not even interested in talkin' to ya. (SFX)
I got 30 dollars in pennies, will that suffice?
Listen, guy. I dunno what your objective is, but I need ya to pipe down, be quiet, or I'm gonna get the district attorney down here, and...
Do you realize that you're talkin' to Reggie Owens? This is Reggie Owens. See, there's another guy there, isn't there?
What do you mean by that?
(To his wife) Sweetheart, put the kids up, some crazy's out in the yard. I mean, you're sittin' there takin' a shit, you're causin' so much chaos over here, we're just sittin' down to eat a meal, and then you call me with this horseshit.
Why don't you pipe down, use your brain, and turn down your TV, put your kettle drum away, and turn down your TV? (SFX)
What is this "kettle drum" that you- there's somebody in the background, you hear it again?
Buddy, your mind is playin' tricks with you, or, if ya got half a mind. (SFX) I'm gonna come up there, and I'm gonna shove you around...
Don't you dare start with the threats. Don't even start with the threats.
I'm gonna let you have it, there, smart guy.
No you ain't!
I've heard enough. I've been up for two nights in a row because of your nonsense. It's nonsense!
Margie told us next door told us that y'all are nothin' but a damn bunch of heatherns [sic], and now you're callin' me, harassin' me? I don't know what else to do over here!
Nonsense - it's pure nonsense! (SFX)
Look - I'm gonna [demand]? that you stop this nonsense!
You're gonna need an Ace bandage, when I'm done with ya. You just are. (SFX)
An Ace bandage? Bring some gauze and some sutures, too, some butterfly sutures, while you're at it, guy.
Why?
This is downright ridiculous.
I've heard enough from you and your ducklings, or whatever ya got.
Ducklings?! It's two fish, they're small kois that we got from a pond. How do you know this, guy?
I've been hearin' it! I've been kept awake all night! (SFX)
You can't hear saltwater fish! For the last damn time, I've told you!
You got a drum circle, I dunno what you're doin'. (SFX)
Look, they're in the background. Get in the bedroom right now! Who is this? You tell me right now who this is.
Wilder.
Van Wilder, right?
That's my name.
And where are you from? Nobody in Alabama acts like this. Do you realize that, sir?
What, you mean with common decency?
(Laugh) Common decency?! This guy here, (cough) you got my damn blood pressure up. I don't even know [unintelligible]. Put the damn kids to bed! When I figure out who this is, fella, do you realize what a world of pain I'm gonna bring? How big of a fella are ya?
I'm about 5'1", 180 pounds.
(Laugh) 180 pounds? 5'1"?
Ya wanna make somethin'...
Ya sound like an Oompa-Loompa, bud. [unintelligible] I wanna throw these hands around. Won't ya come help me out with that, bud... neighbor?
You couldn't kick your own ass, there, smart man.
Joke's on you, 'cause I could. I would beat my ass if I was able to. Do you realize that?
Why don't you just close your mouth, turn off your TV, put your drums away, and just shut 'er down for the night? I've had enough. I've had enough! (SFX)
Just- just shut 'er down, huh?
Absolutely had enough. I just have. (SFX)
You- you- you've had enough?! You have the gall to call me and tell me that you've had enough, when you're the one harassin' me, fella?
I've been listenin' to your horseradish day in, day out, mornin', noon, and night, and I'm through with it! (SFX)
You haven't even been here that long. Look, you're messin' me up from watchin' the Olympics. Usain Bolt is about to win three more golds! Do you even care about your country right now?
I've heard enough country music comin' outta your joint to last me a lifetime. Now pipe down-
'Cause it's the music of angels, sir! Don't you dare talk about country music! You're takin' it to a whole 'nother level with that shit. You need to just cut it out and shut 'er down!
Pipe down, do it now, and I don't wanna hear anything further from ya. You got me?
I'll tell you again, Mr. Wilder- I'm gonna just blow a damn gasket or two, you realize that? Get the kids in bed! Do you hear, there's somebody else on the other line?
On your house?
We- we're tapin' this call right now, fella. Do you realize that?
Sounds like you got about twelve people up 'ere! (SFX)
Hold on - up where?
I've been hearin' so much nonsense, it's blowin' my mind! (SFX)
Look, I think you got some kind of prepaid phone that's causin' all this horseshit - you need to shut 'er down. You're tellin' me I need to shut 'er down? Maybe you're the one that needs to shut 'er down!
You got a freak show somethin' fierce up 'ere. (SFX)
The audacity of you, sir. You call yourself a gentleman actin' like this? On a Sunday? On Sabbath Day, callin' somebody like this, actin' as their neighbor? I'm appalled.

Hello?
This is Smiley Lynch. Your neighbor. (echo effect)
Yes.
Yes, it is. And I've been hearing way too much commotion coming out of your place last night, the night before.
Last night?
(sound effects) I'd like to come to some kind of resolution with 'ye.
Ok, can I...
And it's a mess too. (strange sound effects)
Hello?
Yeah. See, I'm hearing so much commotion at your place, I can't stand it any more. Now, we got to come to some kind of resolution up 'ere. (this echos and pitch shifts). So, what do you think? I'm not...
Sure.
I'm not tryin' to give you a hard time, but jeez, take it down a notch.
Are you talking to the right person? Do you live in the blue house?
I live in the lavender house.
Ok.
And I got your number from the mailman.
Ok.
And I don't understand what possesses you, that you gotta bang a drum, or a pot and a pan, at all hours of the night. Eleven o'clock, eleven-thirty, eleven-forty-five...
Are you talking about last night?
Yes. Yes. Yes I am. (lots of strange sound effects).
Uh, you know I think that you're mistaking me for the ones that live in front of me, because they were the ones that stayed up late last night, not us.
And the night before, and the day before that, and the night before that. It's around the clock. I heard a snake hissin'. Oh, I heard a propeller spinnin' around. Ohhhhh (sound effects). I heard a tambourine, it seemed like. Two o'clock in the morning.
A tambourine?
Ohhhhh. Big one. Real big one. A gong was getting pounded on. And I had a meeting a eight o'clock sheearp, and how am I supposed to do that? I can't even concentrate. (sound effects).

Transportation Services, this is Mike, how can I help you?
Oh yeah, Mike you said? No.
Yes.
No, no, no. Ah, way too loud at night, Mike. I'm hearing way too much sound coming out of your place. Ah...
Out at my place?
Uh huh. I wanted to phone you and see if we could bring it down a couple notches.
Who is this?
I'm Horseshoe, I stay...
Horseshoe?!?
Yes sir. (Laughing sound effects)
I don't know a, I don't know a fucking horseshoe. What fucking horse did you ride in on? You don't know me.
Hey, buddy, take it down a notch or two is all I'm askin'. You got it? 'Cause it's way too loud, too much commotion.
(laughs) It sounds like you better roll out and dial another number buddy, 'cause you got the wrong guy.
Hey, are you reading my mail on that one Charlie? And I want to say there's an odor coming out of your place, it's far out.
(laughs, then LPC make laugh sound effect) Well, the only odor be coming out of my place could be bad pussy, but I don't have any, so I ain't got none of that. So...
I tell ya, you're gonna get smacked around if you make me call back up 'ere.
(Both laugh, LPC's with pitched down effects) I know the voice, but I can't place it.
I'm known as Horseshoe around here, and you'll find out more about me if you make me come up 'ere.
Alright, well come fucking bring down your shit, and let's just see what you got.
Why don't you just button your lip? (brief sound effects) That's behind door number one, you don't want to go behind door number two there, tough guy.
Oh, oh yes, surely I will. (laughs) Tell you what, give me a fucking address and I'll show ya. I'll be there first fucking hand.
Why don't you just button 'er up...
In fact, I'll come over there and fuck you up in your own kitchen.
Nah, you sit tight Charlie, and I'll pay you a visit on a foot.
HA!!!!
And we'll work 'er out.
Wha, wha, you know what? wha, wha, I'm too busy to fuck around like this with somebody on the phone. I'll tell you what, you try to have a nice day, 'cause evidently, ah, you're on the bad side of getting out of the fucking world today. So goodbye.

(Unusual ring sound)
Hello?
Uh-huh?
Goose? What kind of a book is it?
I don't know, I don't speak English, only a little bit.
Mongoose, the magazine?
Ack, where? I don't, what are you talking about? I've got games, I've got comics. I don't even know what it is. Is it a game?
Is it called moose? There's one called 'How Randy the Moose Turned His Frown Upside Down'.
I looked, I looked, I looked, I checked mongoose.
Mongoo? Mongoo, is that an animal?
I'm sorry, I think we're having a problem with our phones. (sound effects) You want to use our bathroom?
Stop calling back! (sound effects)
Hello?
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Yes, I don't know what's happened. Sorry.
I don't know either, I just put someone on hold. Were you calling looking for books with a papoose?
No, (laughs) I was looking for books about mongoose.
Mongoose?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, we have story time this morning, and I can barely hear you.
That, that... (sound effects) Nevermind. (laughs)
I know we don't have anything on mongooses.
I don't have anything about papooses.
This extension...
What's going on? I don't have an extension. (sound effects) I don't understand. There's something weird going on on my phone.
Hello?
Hi, can you tell me how to spell 'papoose'?
P-A-P-O-O-S-E
Ok, that's what I thought. And you're sure they were at the Cathedral Book Store?
I'm sorry?
You said your friend bought it here?
Are, are we, what kind of item are we talking about?
You asked me if we carry a book called Papoose. Right?
Uhhh, no, he asked me if we carried a book called Mongoose.
Oh, you're not yourself?
No, I picked up the phone and there was a male caller, he asked if we carried a magazine called Mongoose. Is this the...(sound effects).
Hello?
Hello? (laughs)
(unintelligible) in the Georgia Tech store?
No, this is the Cathedral Bookstore.
Ohhh, Ok. well...
Oh, weird. And, and (sound effects) Ok.
Alright.
Thanks.
(laughs) You, you're a nut.
Yeah.
So I tried to tell you before, I think there's some sort of a breakdown in communication. I don't know how much clearer I can be. A book called Papoose. I wouldn't know about.
Ok, well if you're going to be rude, I can't help you.
I phoned the goddamn store. So what do you want me to do? I mean this is insane.
I'm sorry if I'm lying to you, or if I'm a dumb person, I can accept that. God bless you, sir.
I don't know what is happening with your phone, but it's got a moose in a mailing carton, and a girl with glasses.
The Major Moose?
He said Super Goose.
Super Goose?
I,I don't know what you guys are talking about. We have Mother Goose.
I don't, that doesn't sound familiar to me.
So, it looks like I have 150 of the Good Luck Mini Moose, I have one Moose On The Loose book, and then three stuffed animals for a different style of moose.
I sorry, I...for the book I Am The Goose?
Moose On The Loose, is the only book I have.
Moose On The Loose? And that's the one that you're looking for?
Ok. You guys need a bunch of moose stuff?
Oh, umm, I'm not entirely sure what's going on.
This is a toy store. You guys called us, looking for moose stuff.
Ok, sir, I'm really confused right now. (laughs). Uhh...
Who are you?
I work with Book People.
Ok.
So, I don't know exactly what's going on.
He asked me to be put on hold, and well...anyway.
Yeah.
I'm not sure why you guys are calling me.
Uh, what's the book that it was...
He said Mongoose.
To me he said Caboose, so I thought it might be The Little Red Caboose.
So I'm not sure, Ok?
Uhh. Yeah, I think calling your friend is probably gonna be the best...
He is not a friend of mine, ok?
Ok. Alright.
Hello?
Hello.
This is The California Book Store. And somebody transferred to you.
Yeah, so, you are now the third book store that has called me and asked me about a book.
Ohhhhh. (Unintelligible)
So I don't know which book they're looking for. So do I win a prize, or, I mean, what's going on here?
Uh, no, he said The Goose.
Ok, so, first person said Mongoose, second person said Caboose, and this person said Goose. So...
Yeah...
I don't know what's going on, but I'm actually getting a little tired of all the phone calls.
Yeah, no, yeah, ok, he is your friend?
Not my friend.
Ohhh, I'm sorry, somebody hung up.
Your calling a business, then another business called me, then another business called me, and then now you called me.
Ok, ok, sure ok.
Yes, this is City Lights. I think your friend transferred me over to you.
Not my friend.
He's looking for The Papoose Book?
So, you're the fifth or sixth call, I feel like I'm in some sort of Twilight Zone.
Uh-huh.
So what do you think he's looking for?
Oh, there's a book that he said his friend got here, called Papoose.
No idea. So first it was Mongoose, then it was Caboose, then it was Goose, now it's Papoose. But he is a super freak and I've had calls from Book People, some woman who didn't speak English, and now you and...
Woah. Oh hey, ok. (sound effects start) Woah, he sounded so, kind of official, and like he was really... (more sound effects)...knew what he was talking about.
Yeah, it's gonna get worse, I don't know.
Ah, man. How surreal, ok.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hi. Hi. Can you hear me?
(2 voices at once) Yes.
Ok, so, I, I'm searching for Mad Goose? Is that...
I thought it was Mongoose, ok let's see.
Mongoose?
Mongoose?
I...
(High pitched sound effects)
I don't see anything in our system for Mongoose.
(belchy sound effects)
Uh...(laughs)...who am I speaking to?
This is Women And Children First.
Oh. I'm not really sure...
Mon...yeah. Mongoose is...
Uh, you're both looking (laughs)...
Yeah, this is weird. A gentleman called and said I'm looking for Mad Goose...
Yeah...(unintelligible)
But now we have Mongoose. Ok, well I don't have any Mongoose...
Ok. (laughs)
Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you the person who's looking for The Mongoose?
I think you guys called for it. Did one of you call for it?
You were looking for a book called I Am The Masseuse? Right?
This is bizarre. (laughs).
(high pitched sound effects)
Hello?
Is this a serious phone call, because...
I don't know what's going on. (laughs)
Hello?
Hey.
Who...(laughs)...Something may have just happened. Did someone call you?
Yeah.
Was he a strange fella? He was just asking me the most strange questions I've ever had on a phone call.
(belchy sound effects)
Hello? Hello?
Are you hearing that?
Yeah, that was strange.
This is very weird.
This seems to have gotten strange.
Are, are you hearing that?
(short sound effects burst)
Yes, I'm listening, and I'm struggling 'cause I have customers in the store.
Oh, oh, you want to start all over?
Someone called asking if we had The Mad Goose.
What kinda goose?
Mad Goose.
Mad Goose...
This is really totally weird. The person just called and asked...
This is a totally weird call.
...To ask for a mongoose?
(laughs) I was told The Mad Goose.
It's called Mad Goose?
No.
No, Okay. It's not a masseuse?
The masseuse?
Hi, were you asking about a book called I Am The Masseuse?
No!
The masseuse?
No!
I never had a weird phone call like this, ever.
It's weird! It's vibrating and it's...I don't even know, and I never even heard of the mongoose.
I'm sorry, no, I don't carry a book called Vamoose. (piano music starts)
No?
Is there a piano playing? I can't, I can't really hear you.
I hear that too.
Alright, can you, can you call me back in a minute?
Oh, okay. I couldn't really hear you over the music too much.
Hello?
Uh.
Hello?
(Simultaneous talking hard to understand)...Yes, sorry, you have two people on the line
...getting a lot of background noise here.
(Piano music continues) Uh, you have two of us on the line at the same time.
I, I can't hear you. Hello?
You have two of us on the line at the same time.
Hi there.
Are we on two lines here?
I think we're on two lines here.
(simultaneous talking) Okay, I was answering a question here for the bookstore.
Someone just called...I'm sorry? Can I help you?
Uh, no, I actually just received a call from a gentleman who was looking for a book titled Vamoose. (Dramatic piano music)
What's that?
You're an interesting person. (laughs).
Is it titled Mongoose?
Is it? I'm trying to look up something for someone. Uh, they gave me Vamoose.
Wha - How can I help?
I'm confused. I was getting back to someone who was on line one.
Yeah.
Oh, we're on a conference call.
I don't know. (Laughs).
Happy bookselling.
I think you are mistaken.
I'm so sorry, we...
you are mistaken.
I, I'm so sorry.
I don't need your attitude.
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
What's wrong with you?
I'm rather confused myself.
You are not welcome here.
At first it was a guy on the phone.
Do not call here again.
I'm here, I'm here, I'm back.
Did you call my father yesterday, and talk to a 79 year old man this way?
(laughter)
Is that what you did? You fucking weakling.
Yeah, yeah.
You speak to my father that way again, we're gonna have a real problem.
I don't know what the heck just happened.
You're a fucking weakling.
Man goose?
You're mentally ill.
I was told to ask you about The Vamoose Book you bought, so your friend could buy it.
I'd talk to your friend, he was insulting, and, uh, I thought it was odd.
No, he said that you were his friend.
No, No, No, so just talk me through it. So why is your friend calling us? Who is your friend? And why is he doing this?
Sir, this is a business, I don't know what the hell's going on.
No, no, we're a business too, so I'm trying to figure out who's doing this.
I have no idea.
Kay, he threatened to come in and piss on our floor. And this is really gross, I would love to get my hands on the person who did this.
Please take us off your call list.

Ok. There's emerging data on what the tokens are worth, so you'll be sort of an investor. So, we wear stilts on election day, so people can see us. Loud and proud on voting day. Are you with us on that one?
I'm gonna be in South America on election day, I'm gonna be, uh, sending my vote in ahead of time.
Well, if you'd like to wear stilts, just give us a holler, and we can arrange that.

Where are you at?
I'm in our call center.
Where's your call center?
We're non-disclosure oriented, sir.
Well I'm non-disclosure oriented. If you keep bothering me...
Yeah.
...I will turn you into the government, ok?
What branch?
Whatever branch I want to. Look, I served in the military, you piece of shit.
What branch of the military?
Navy. During the Vietnam War. And you know, I,I,I,I served not to have fucking assholes like you calling me up on the phone and bothering me.
I bet you...
I SAID, I'm not telling you. What more do you need to know?
I bet you dodged the draft altogether.
I didn't dodge the draft. You know, sir, I don't care what you think. And you know what? If you're that fucking ballsy, come in here and say that to my face. That's all I ask.
I'll come in there if you tell me who you're voting for. Sure I will.
I,I, I'll tell you, you come in here, and I'll tell you who I'm voting for.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
You just want the free sandwich. Is that it?
No, I don't want free shit from anybody.

What do you mean, 'no'?
You know, you're either the stupidest mother fucker out there, or you just want to bother people on the phone.
I want answers, is what I want.
You got answers.
That you dodged the draft? That's not anything at all.
No, I didn't dodge the draft, you piece of shit.
Oh, yeah ya did.
I served our fucking country, you piece of shit. And if you don't like what I'm saying, come in here and tell me that.
You're not registered to vote, and you dodged the draft.
I'm registered to vote, it's none of your fucking business who I vote for.
That's what I'm putting down.
There's a reason they have a little curtain on a lot of the register booths, and when you go up there, you're by yourself, nobody watches you vote.
Oh yeah, well...
...That is one of the privileges of being in our country. Did you know that?
Well I vote on stilts, twenty feet in the air, so people know that I'm voting. Loud...
...That's good.
Loud and proud.
Hey, Good bye, hey, don't call me call me back mother fucker...
...Sir, give me the information we need. Who are you voting for?
Like I said, I'm not telling anyone.
We don't share the information.
No, I don't care about sharing. I,I,I...I have your phone number. I'm tracing to find out where you're at.
Just answer the question...
...DID YOU HEAR ME?!? I said, I am not telling anyone. Not only that, but this is a business. You're bothering me at my job.
I'm a patriot.
Yeah, uh, sir?
Tell me what I need to know.
This is a fucking free country. I can do what I want.

Hello?
Hi, thi is Ewan with UPS. How you doing tonight, miss?
I'm good, how are you?
Fine. I've been trying to bring three, four parcels up 'ere, and no one's come to the door, each time that I'm up 'ere.
Up where? What's the address you're trying to bring them to?
I've got some plants and flowers you ordered. And uhh...
I don't think I ordered any plants and flowers.
Yeah, didiwompus.
Wha, wha, What's the add-What is the address you're trying to deliver them to?
I've got didiwompus, and I've got 'em on the truck. I've got two stops ahead of you, but I could be there in about forty-five minutes, if you're gonna answer the door this time, that's certainly no problem (echo). Ok? (echo). C.O.D., eighty-two dollars even
Oh, just take a hike, buddy.
(ring)
(unintelligible) I've asked you three times, what is the fricking address you're trying to deliver them to?
Is this Pam, or wha, who is this?
What is the address you're trying to deliver them to?!?
I've got the address right he- here on my tablet.
Then say it to me! SAY IT!
I've already been there three times, and you didn't answer the bell.
Say the address buddy or I'm hanging up again! You can go to hell.
I've got your didiwompus flowers right here.
(ring)
Hello?
Hi, is Pam there, please?
No, she's not. This is Tom.
Oh, Hi Tom.
What's up?
I need to talk to her about her delivery.
There's no delivery dude.
Uh, yeah, I've been up there three times, no one came to the door.
So?
So!?!
So why are you calling this number? I mean, we didn't order any flowers.
Didiwompus, is what they're called.
(chuckle) Who cares?
I do. I'm trying to do my job, and you're making that real difficult, as a matter a fact.
Yeah, but your job has gone haywire.
Is that a fact?
You're absolutely, positively not gonna get a dime, ok? So why are you wasting your time?
Well, I'll come back up there. I gota few stops to make on the way, but, ah, so you'll have to wait a few minutes.
Dude, did you hear? We, we didn't order them...
Pooninny.
...and we're not obligated to take some stupid delivery from some dick head that is harassing us by calling this number.
Pooninny, that's the name of the plant.
Huh?
Pooninny and didiwompus. I got a big bundle of parcels here.
So what?? So what? We didn't order them.
(next two lines are delivered simultaneously, with the speakers talking over eachother)
Do, Do you understand that, you are trying to deliver something, and...
(LPC) Did you just cha...Did you just change your mind about (can't understand)
...we would never order anything that stupid. Ok?
(LPC)
I hear that all the time. People change their mind, oh 'I didn't order this, I didn't order that
Hey, dude, oh yeah, right.
You know what, why don't you just get with the program,(pitch down effect) step up to the plate, and answer your dawgone dorm bell next time I come up 'ere.
Dude.
Am I making myself clear? Am I understood?
About what?
About the fact - I got pooninnies, I got didiwompus, taking up a lot of space in my truck, and you're running me around.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, dude.
Put Pam on the phone.
OK Man. (in a lower voice, perhaps imitating LPC pitch down effects).
I need a credit card number. Put her on the line.
Hey, oh like that's gonna happen.
Put her on the line, buddy.
I mean, no. Are you telling me what to do?
Sure am.
Well, you can just stick it up your ass, ok?
What are you gonna do about it? Not answer the door again? That's real neat.
No, I will-You come to this door, I will answer it.
I will be there
Ok.
I got four stops ahead of me...
Ok, no, who cares?
My customers, my considerate customers. Not like you guys.
Dude, you - Ok, you know what? My son-in-law is a police officer, he's a sergent with the Kansas City, Missouri police force...
Oh, wow.
...he'll be waiting for you too. Ok? So come on.
Kansas City police force.
Let's, let's do it. Expect to spend the night in jail.

Hi there.

Spencer.
Hello?
I’ve got this uh, rare Helix mimeograph, the band Helix.
What? Why do you have my number?
It’s a rare mimeograph, and it’s (SFX) got…
How did you get my number?
From the label, the record company.
What label?
From Helix’s record company. And they said you could authenticate this thing.
This is ridiculous.
Uh, there’s a controversial image on there. I need to know who I’m talkin’ to here.
The wrong number, man.
You don’t remember the band Helix, huh?
(ring)
Hello?
Hi, I’m calling on this Helix thing here.
Yes (unintelligible) you have the wrong number.
I don’t! The singer of Helix gave me your number.
Who the fuck is Helix? I don’t know who Helix is.
Old school metal.
Okay, well I don’t know who they are, and I don’t have time for this…
Oh, they’ve got a hot sound.
…(unintelligible), you have the wrong number.
It’s a mimeograph, there’s some very controversial images on this, uh, document. And I need to know, uh, that you’re gonna, use discretion, once I bring it up ‘ere.
I don’t care about whatever this thing is. Please stop calling me.
The singer of Helix gave me your fricking digits.
I don’t know who Helix is, okay?
Old school metal.
Well that says nothing to me...
Why can’t…
…I don’t know who this person is, I don’t why he gave you my number. But please, stop it.
Hey…
I don’t care about a mimeograph.
Authenticate this thing, and we’ll get ‘er accomplished.
What do you fucking want from me? Oh my God, stop, shut up.
We’ll pay you.
(music plays)
Hello?

Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center, this is Steve.
I've got a court ordered, uh, individual to bring in there this afternoon. Name's Skippy. I just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's scheduling Skippy?
He's just having a real hard time adjusting. Can you talk to him for a moment? He's...
Whoa, but, but...First of all, who from Impact scheduled him?
Uh, that information I don't have at my fingertips.
Because we don't just bring people in that are court ordered.
Can you talk to Skippy for a moment? Just let him know that he'll be in good hands.
No sir. No sir. Can, ca, do you have a contact...
(with strange sound effects) What do ya NEEEEEEED? Tell me whatcha NEEEEEEEED!
(Laughs while sound effects continue) What's up Skippy?!?
(Down pitched effect) This is Skippy!
That sounds really...
What do ya Neeeeed? Tell me what you're trying to neeeeeeed!
(Laughs while sound effects continue) People go to jail for this. (?-Not sure this is accurate)
Can you, can you just try to talk some sense into him, please? I'm trying to hold the guy down, to talk to ya.
Wow.
Here, just talk to him...(sound effects start)...What do ya NEEEED?!? TELL ME WHATCHA NEEEEEEEED! I don't know whatcha NEEEEEEED! What are ya trying to NEEEEED? What do ya need?
(Laughs while sound effects continue)
He took off.
Oh my God, you, why couldn't you hold him down?
I tried, he's a big fella.
(Laughs) Who is this?
My name's David Chandler, I'm an attorney.
Ok.
Skippy was court ordered to get some rehabilitation, I thought you guys could, you know sorta, grease the wheels, so to speak.
No, Skippy has to have a willing heart. He has to want to change.
Well, here he is again, hold on. Skippy talk to gentleman again. (Skippy sound effects start again) What are you trying to Neeeeeed? (sound effects continue for several seconds).
(Laughs while sound effects continue) Who is that?
(Third voice enters call, LPC and this voice continue conversation until end of call) Hey, who am I speaking with?
David Chandler, Attorney.
You're sticking to the script.
That's my profession.
So, how may I help you David?
I wanted you to talk to Skippy.
Put Skippy on the phone.
Oh, well here. (Sound effects start)

Ableton support, this is Lucas. How can I help?
This is Stewie. I'm trying to use this recording program here, and I'm just having a heck of a time here. Everything's warbling and fouled up.
Ok. Ummm, yeah, I'm happy to help here, could I get the email address of your Ableton dot com account?
It's Dickie at Prime Mail dot Biz. And I'm just having a gargantuan problem here with my recording and playback, there's crosstalk and cancellation on pretty much everything i try to do. And it's just not helping. I went to Guitar Center, and they're not able to tell me a doggone thing up 'ere. (Sound effects).
Hmmm, Ok, ummm, let's see. I don't see, uh, I'm not seeing an account under this, uh, Dickie, is that: D-I-C-K-Y?
It's I-E.
It's I-E? And then it's Prime Mail, P-R-I-M-E Mail dot Biz? B-I-Z?
Yes.
Ok, I'm not seeing an account under that email address. Umm, is there maybe another one that...
(Very low pitched sound effects) Well, sure. Where you coming from now? I can't...
What's that?
This thing's defective, sir.
Umm, I, I, just, yeah...
I paid cash on the barrel, and I'm hearing...
Ok, which version of Live are you using?
...and I'm hearing. Uh, version ten. I paid cash on the barrel, and I'm hearing bullfrogs and birds and everything going on. Bubbles. (Echos and sound effects continue over the next line).
I'm wondering if um, I'm wondering if maybe you've got the wrong product here, we don't have a Live ten.
Or one point oh, I guess.
Uh, we also don't, I mean Live one point oh is a product from 1999, so I don't think that's it.
Do you know what phase cancellation sounds like?
Yeah, absolutely.
Oh, really. It's sounds like snakes are nesting inside of my recordings. I got an acoustic guitar, (sound effects) sounds like a sitar goin' wild up 'ere. (Sound effects).
Ok, and so, uh, yeah, so ummm.
I'm hearing voices...
Unfortunately I can't really, I can't really help you out further, if you can't give me a, uh, email address...
I'm hearing different languages on tape. (Echo sound effects). I'm hearing insects and, uh, wildlife. This is just acoustic based project that I'm trying to run here.
Interesting, I see. I see, I see.
So, can't we work something through? I went to Guitar Center, they told me to call you. I can't make it work with the sounds I'm hearing. (strange sound effects persist to end of call).
Yeah, I see, I see. That sounds pretty tricky there. I'm definitely hearing some strange things over here on my end as well. Uh, yeah, that's some very bizarre sounds.
Everything's in double time. I'm hearing foreign languages.
I gotta say, your voice sounds very familiar, I think maybe I've spoken with you before?
Well, I've had this issue pop up from time to time. It sounds like I got a frog inside of my microphone here.
(Laughs) Yeah...Yeah. Uhhh...Well listen, I do think, uh, it sounds like you've got a pretty serious problem there, but, umm, but without, without figuring out your license details here, I can't really spend anymore time with you on this.
Buddy, I've given you my email address, I've got my receipt in hand, and I paid cash on the barrel.
Well, I'll tell you what, I can send you, uh, I can't, I can't stay on the phone here with you, ummm, but I'm happy to send you an email at that address. And then if you could just reply to that, we'll kind of work towards figuring out what's going on with your license there, OK?
It sounds like I got a primate running wild! In my recording space.
(Laughs) Yeah, I (laughs) I understand sir, definitely. Ummm, look, I can't really spend anymore time on the phone here with you, but I appreciate you calling, and, uh maybe try us back another time. I would love to recommend you call us back, alright thanks for calling. Bye.

(Radio station recording) 630 KHOW, an I Heart Radio station.
Hi Tom Martino here, welcome. 303-713-TALK. 713-8255. Grover's got a comment on that Rocky Mountain painting and the door jamb, with that woman. What's your comment there, Grover?
(LPC distorted vocals) This lady had a house? She owned a house, she said. How do people like that get a house?
(Laughs) What?
She's so mealy-mouthed, I couldn't believe it.
So, what, would, would you feel she was, like what? Nitpicking?
She was on the air for two days 'Oh, this guy's ripping me off, but I don't want you to talk to him. Be nice to him. Well, maybe I should talk to my dad, I don't know.' (LPC sound effects increase)
(Other radio host) Yeah, I missed that yesterday, she goes 'If I put him on the phone, just don't yell at him'.
(Tom Martino) Oh, I see. (LPC sound effects) Thank you Grover. Dan? Wow. Dan, what's happening? Dan? I don't hear Dan, so I'm just gonna go (female radio voice "Oh Shucks") to Skipper. What's going on with your cell phone?
(LPC) Hi, I bought a cell phone new at the shop at Colfax and Potomac, right off Potomac there...
Now, you bought a new cell phone? very seldom do people just buy a cell phone, they usually sign up with a carrier. Now was this a store, ah, a carrier, or ju, or just buying the phone?
It was a store called Big Mama's, I just bought the phone outright, it's a Motorola.
Okay, and what kind of phone?
Motorola Z-force.
Z-force? Is it an older one, or is it one of the newer ones?
It's one of the newer ones, and I'm hearing voices, and beeping, and crazy sounds. And when I call them, they say they're not responsible for the learning curve of the end user, but that's not what it's about...
Now, this was a brand new, this was a brand new phone, right?
Yeah.
Okay. And what carrier do you have?
AT and T. And it's going crazy, it's making noises and sounds, and it's freaking out, the phone is.
Really? And, and, and how are you at tech, at technology? Are you pretty good?
(LPC deepens and distorts voice) I don't know what's going on with this phone. I don't know at all. I'm alright.
Ahhhhh, you joking, you're joking me, bud.
Huh? No.
Come on, you, you just did that with your voice. How'd you do that?
Big Mama's, is the one who sold it to me.
Do it again, do it again Skipper, make your voice go slow again.
Big Mama's is the one who sold it to me.
Make it go slower. How do you do that?
(Very low pitch) I don't know what you're talking about. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Do you, Skipper, do you have a synthesizer?
(LPC sound effects continue on laughing) It's this phone.
That is so cool.
I'm telling you, this phone is wacked out.
Skipper, Skipper, let me know how you're doing that, I want that for my phone, how are you doing it?
It's wacked out something fierce, I can tell you that right now. (LPC effects) It's this phone.
What is the name of the app you're using? (LPC sound effects increase)
I went to Big Mama's, on Potomac...
(Laughs) I want to know the name of that app.
Big Mama's. (SFX)
Get it out of him Daphne. (LPC SFX continue) Try to find out what app he uses to do that, that voice stuff. I like that. I imagine there's a number of them. I'm looking up Z-Force, Motorola, I don't even see one. Oh, yeah, I see one. There actually is one, but I thought, he's not for real, he doesn't have a problem. That is pretty cool, though.

Hey there, welcome back. It's ... ten-oh-six, hour number two of Around The House. Good to have you with us here on the program. Let's get back to the phones now. Buddy in Erie, thanks for waiting. You're on the air with Ken Moon Around The House, what's goin' on?
Good morning!
Hi!
Hi. I ... got some goof-off on my slats ... on the ground. And I took a Dremel to it. And ... turns out, I'm straight down to the rebar now. And I got gyp board down there, and ... there's gussets down there and everything else, so, my question is, if I've got a heel-cut, sort of a honeycomb ... (echoing, inaudible) ... up there and I got a heat pump runnin' through there, it's in the compression and decompression that heats everything, cools everything... can I hotwire a hose bib up there to get a hurricane clip ... (echoing increases) ... to just secure everything that's going through the home when I prepare completion my on the towel prompter, prompt (inaudible) ...
We're ... we're gonna have to put him on hold–
Brambling–
... We're ... we'll have to get him to call back, ah, if you can put him on hold, Jason, ah, 'cos that was just an odd connection, don't understand what's goin' on. In the meantime, Richie. Richie, you're on the air with Ken Moon around the house. Ah, good morning!
Hi Ken!
Hi!
I was in my, ah, crawlspace, ah, earlier in the week, and I saw a downspout in there, ah and some horizontal gutters. Uhm, and there's a drip cap! Uh, attached to an earthquake strap? Uh, in the easement. So, the overhang, of the uh, exterior roof kind of comes through there at an elbow, in an electric lateral. So, with an elevation sheet, should I be able to get an evaporator coil around the expansion joint to kinda get some wonderboard in there? Or maybe, ah, some facing brick, with some fishtape, maybe? Uhm, with the grain of the grade beam, kind of a laminated beam, and, around the gloat valve? And the gloss enamel's just comin' loose! And the-
(Sighs). Hey, Mike, uh, Mike Wolfe. Let's dump this caller. Ah, I have no idea, Richie, what you're talking about, maybe you need ... to take another pill and settle down this morning I guess, huh? The perils of live radio. I apologize for that, but we're back here with the program at twenty-one minutes after ten o'clock, and ... Huey, in Ken Caryl Ranch, good morning, you're on the air, hi!
Hi Ken!
Hi!
I had to ask you about ... pests. Pesky animals.
Yeah. Yeah!
Well, it started with my fireplace, it started with fruit, really. Smelled like apple pie, or somethin', every time I used my fireplace, you know?
... Uhuh-
And then I looked in there, and I saw a bunch of
apples–
Ah!
And then I saw ... raccoons, just runnin' wild, and they were storin' ... apples in there, OH they were runnin' wild. So, what would you ... do? With the constant presence of raccoons in your fireplace.
Well, (laughs), well, well, this, is it a mom & babies inside there?
Yeah. There's a whole clan.
Yeah, I'll bet there is. This is the time of year when they breed and, and uh, whelp, if you will, or have their litters, and usually there's, what, five or six little babies with each, uh, each litter. Well, you gotta get 'em out of there before you do anything because if you trap 'em in there they'll die, and you think the apples smell bad! If you have dead raccoons in your fireplace flue [chuckles] .. so you're gonna have to trap them. Have either you or an animal control person's gonna have to trap them and release them far, far away. And then put a-you can put a screen. Y'know, kind of a uh a uh a uh reh uh ah uh ruh ah eh uh uh a spark arrestor cap. A steel cap, over your fireplace and the gaps are little enough that they can't get back in there. So that's really the way to do that but you gotta get rid of em first. And you might, you might try some of the repellent products that you can spray, maybe you wanna, uh, sp ... I mean, I think they come out at night to feed as I remember. So maybe at sundown you can get up there and shine a strong flashlight down in the chimney, and if they're gone, man, that's great! If you look down there and there's none left cause they've gone foraging then of course you can just cover that fireplace flue opening with a piece of wood, or cardboard or plywood or,
Yeah!
Yeah. Put a couple bricks on it, and then get that spark arrestor cap so they can't, they won't ever come back because they can't get through that gap. So that's ... what I would use but get 'em out of there and I think night time is the best time to do that.
Well that sounds a lot better than what I tried. That's for sure.
What'd you try?
I put some mannequins in there? But these were like, pressure treated with pressurised chemicals, they're like the ... Cadillac of mannequins. And I put them in there and I kept adding stuff, like, I added wigs on there and [LPC's voice starts to echo] leather jackets, and I added a horse whip! And I added, I added-
Ah you tried, like a s-,
chin strap-
Like a scarecrow kind of thing, huh?
[LPC echoing and distorting more and more]
Yeah I added a chinstrap and even ordered a bullwhip and I added a wig and I added all kinds of stuff and I added some different things, I had like a cactus in there, I added all kinds of different things and they kept comin' out and kept comin', kept comin', kept comin'-
Sounds ... sounds like a vaudeville routine! And not ... not trying to get rid of a -... Hey listen, I gotta get rid of- I can barely understand you, so we'll let you go.
Aa
a
oaO
o
aaaoa
A
ooo
o
Ooo
Let's let him go, Jason. Yeah. I don't know what he, ah, uh ... he kind of lost me at the end there, mannequins and stuff. But ... maybe he was trying to do a scarecrow thing that [laughs awkwardly] wasn't very effective! I don't know, but, you can't trap 'em in there! You gotta get rid of em some other way. I don't know if that last part was...? Was that ... was he putting me on? I, you know, somethin', I could barely hear what he was sayin', but it sounded like wigs and whips and mannequins and leather jackets? Maybe he called the wrong show! Maybe that's it. Lance in the Springs, good morning!
[Lance] Well, thank you very much for letting me follow up THAT call, Ken, I appreciate that!
I know! I, he was sounding relatively sane until the very end, but anyway, go ahead.
[Lance] I-I-I know raccoons are really bad but I think that if you've got that many mannequins on hand with all the wardrobe for 'em I think you've got other issues.
[laughing] Yeah I think, I think so!
[Lance] And then I'm glad that you're back, I hope you're feelin' better and, just you know, like that last guy, watch out for mannequins, I guess.
Yeah, I know! [Laughing] I didn't mean, you know, every caller and every listener to this show is very precious, and Huey, I didn't mean to offend you but your cell was so ... choppy there I just couldn't ... see what you were up to. But ... I'm not sure it's ... really wanted to know. Anyway, so, uh, anyway, thanks, Lance for your call. [Laughs] Let's get Tony in the Springs on the air right now, good morning.
[Tony] Good morning, Ken, how are you?
I'm doing fine, just in response to the last caller I'm still in recovery, but ... I AM recovering! So that's all good news.
NOTE: Near the end of the call a third voice enters the call. This voice is identified as "Alex Trebek" in the transcription, which is an educated guess based on previous calls to Alex. However, there is no definitive indication that it is Alex.

Hello?
(LPC voice very warbling) Hi, yeah. Uh, Leo please.
Who's calling?
This is Farney, with United Parcel Service. I'm an accountant at United Parcel Service. (Sound effects)

Hello?
(Sound effects) Yes, um, ma'am, you've got a parcel from Historical Hair, here with UPS.
STOP CALLING!
Now can we get this settled up, or...
I'm going to take this number, and report it. Now stop.
Just read us the credit card number.
We have no UPS account...balance.
Just read us the credit card number and we'll take care of it here today.
No, yeah, sure. Like I'm gonna give you my credit card number. You're an idiot.
Or a routing number, okay? Just read it to me slowly, and we'll take care of it here today. (Sound effects)
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
Miss, yes, you've got a small balance here, with Historical Hair.
You know what, how many times are you gonna call, and from how many different numbers?
We need a credit card number today. Okay?
Yeah, yeah (unintelligible). What do you think, I'm stupid?
Well, no, no, you ordered...
Like I'm gonna give you a cr...We never ordered anything from that place...So don't...
Historical Hair, that's the name of the company. Okay?
I've never heard of that company before.
Which one?

Just read it to...
What ro...you're a je...

(ring)
Hello?
(LPC sound effects on voice) Ah yes, uh, I'm calling on behalf of UPS. I'm an accountant up here. And, uh, you've got a small balance, 178 dollar balance from Historical Hair dot com. Okay? So if we could just settle payment up today, then we'll be squared away. Okay?
Well, I don't think so. If you, if you got, if you got, if you got something send out a bill. Because after I get the bill, I'm turning it over to my attorney. I'm contacting the state police. And I'm turning all this information over to them. Because you guys are running a scam. I'm sick and tired of it.
What do you mean there?
If you got, if you (sigh).
A scam?
Look, you called from the different, you called from three different numbers...
Hey.
...from three different places.
(LPC sound effects) I don't follow you there. You have a small balance from Historical Hair. End of paragraph, okay?
Kiss my historical hair.
I'm trying to do my job, sir. You're really making that...
Well, well, you, you ain't got a job. Your job is nothing but scam, your job is nothing but scamming people.
(LPC effects) Listen, just read me the credit card number, and we'll work it out, okay? Just read it to me slowly, okay?
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...blah...blah.

Hello?
This is Cindy with United Parcel Service. Uh, sir, you've got a package here from Historical Hair, we're trying to deliver. And receive payment on. And apparently you've had a problem with our driver, of some kind. (Sound effects). Can we work this out today, please sir?
Well, what do you want?
Uh, we need a credit card number, and a good time to deliver from ya, okay? (Sound effects) Can we work something thruuuuu, or?
Now, what company is this from?
I'm with UPS. The parcel you ordered is from Historical Hair.
Wha, what does, what does UPS stand for? U.P.S., what's that stand for?
Whatever scam you're trying to run, we don't stand for that, I can guarantee ya. United Parcel Service, sir.
Oh, well I don't know, it sounds like you work for (LPC sound effects). Hello?
What's that now?
You keep putting this crap on my phone. You won't talk to me.
I'm talking to you, plain English, loud and clear, right here. What is your concern, sir? Why can't you pay for your item, that you ordered? Historical Hair.
First of all, I didn't order anything.
Oh no?
Now, I don't know if there's a mistake with this company, but I never received a tracking number. Send me the tracking number, let me see what's going on with this. And you guys refuse to do that. Now, if this was United Postal Service, like you're telling me, they would supply me with a tracking number. And you're not.
It's United PARCEL Service, not Postal Service, so get that straight. Okay?
Well let's get this straight, U.P.S. to me stands for Useless Piece of Shit!
(LPC Sound effects) I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. Okay?
Well, I want you to understand that, that's what I said. Useless piece of shit! You have a problem with that?!? If you have a problem with that, don't call me anymore! Do you understand that, you fucking asshole?!?
This is a scam.
I'm tired of your fucking shit!
You got a fraud game goin' up there.
Yeah, you sure do asshole.
Look, we need you to pay for your parcel, end of story.
I ain't paying for crap. I didn't order anything! Now, if you have a statement, send me a bill. I told this asshole that called last time, send me a fucking statement, 'cause I'm turning it over to my attorney. 'Cause the next time I get a phone call from you assholes, I'm writing the fucking number down, and I'm reporting you to Homeland Fucking Security! You understand that, asshole?
(LPC Sound effects) Historical Hair. Historical Hair is the company you ordered from. You got it?
Then deliver my package, asshole!
Not 'till we get a credit card number, no sir.
Well then go fuck yourself.
(LPC sound effects on "Not 'till we get a credit card number, no sir.")

Hello?
Hi, this is Becky with United Parcel Service. Is Leo there, sir? We’ve got a parcel here for you. I’m trying to resolve this, uh, package delivery with you.
Deliver the package.
I’m looking at a past due, and we need a routing number today, and we’ll get that delivered.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Deliver the package, and I’ll pay you when you bring it. Supposedly that’s what your telling me, it’s C.O.D. Deliver the package and I’ll give you money.
Uh, we’re a little past that, sir. You’ve…
Well, then…you got, you got, you got problems. Take it up with your Historical Hair people.
(Hang up sound)
Hello?
(LPC distorted) Yeah, this is Dick with UPS. Ah, what appears to be the trouble up here, sir?
Ah, you’re a Useless Piece of Shit guy, huh? (Pounding sound)
Sir, we’re in need of a payment today to resolve your past due on your account.
(pounding sound) You’re breaking up, I can’t hear you.
You’ve got a parcel here on our dock from Historical Hair dot com, and we’re trying to get a past due resolved today, sir. What appears to be the trouble today? I’m an administrator up here.
Well I’m dealing with a company called Useless Piece of Shit.
Sir, would you please be professional? Okay?
You’re not!
Well after fourteen months on the job, I’m not professional, huh? You talked to our driver, and you talked to our other representatives, and you’ve got an issue of some kind. That’s why I’m phoning you. What’s your concern today, sir?
Well, how come when the delivery man was here the other day, he said nothing about this?
I don’t know who you’re referring to, sir.
Alright, I’m calling the United Postal Service, I’m reporting you to them, that you’re running a scam.
It’s United PARCEL Service, sir. It’s the same problem we had last time.
Deliver the package then! If you got a package for me, deliver the package.
Read the credit card number and the expiration date, and we’ll be there within the hour.
No, you come out to my house first, and I’ll give it to you then. I ain’t giving you no number over the phone. You’re gonna have to send me out a statement. Send me a bill.
It’s a little past that. We sent two statements.
Well, if, if, you, you haven’t send me shit, asshole! Send me, send me a statement so I can turn it over to my attorney.
Just read the number slowly. Okay?
You want the number? One-Eight-Hundred-Kiss-My-Ass!
Historical Hair dot com? That doesn’t ring a bell, huh?
I never heard of that company before in my life.
I hear that all the time. Oh, I changed my mind, I don’t…
Well then I guess you, you run scam on a lot of people then, huh?
It must be for your wife, sir. Now let me talk to your wife, and we’ll resolve this with her credit card.
Why do you have to talk to somebody else?
Maybe it was a Christmas gift, you don’t know anything about it.
Aye, well I’ll tell you this. I think the longer I’m able to keep you on the phone’s the less time you’ve got to fuck with somebody else. So come on, let’s carry on this conversation.
Now read me the credit card number, this is the last time I’m gonna ask you, read it to me slowly, and we’ll credit your…
And then, what if I don’t? Then what are you gonna do? Why don’t you come over here, deliver my package, so I can kick you in the fucking balls.
I’m an administrator, not a truck driver.
Well, still come on over to my house, so I can kick you in the fucking balls.
You’re running a fraud game, that’s all you’re doing.
NO! I ain’t running no fraud game. I’m just telling you, come over to my house, so I can kick you in the balls. You got the address, supposedly your supposed to make a delivery. Stop by the house, I’ll kick you in the balls, and I’ll give you a check. How’s that sound? Stop by my house, let me kick you in the balls.
I’m gonna transfer you to my manager, sir. I can’t get through to you.
Sure.
(Arthur the Gargler) Crime desk, what can I do for you? (pause) Well speak English.
(Man) Who do you work for?
(Arthur) Who the hell wants to know? I think I know that voice too.
(Man) I got somebody calling me from, saying they’re from, uh, uh, UPS, this Useless Piece of Shit company. They want money. I tell them to come by and pick it up, and I’ll kick ‘em in the balls, but they don’t want to come over here.
(Arthur) I don’t even know who I’m talking to.
(man) So if they don’t want to do that, don’t bother coming out to my house anymore. Don’t bother calling me.
(Arthur) Who the hell are you? I don’t come out to your house. Are you ashamed of your name?
(Man) The driver’s supposed come out here and make a delivery. You haven’t made a delivery.
(Arthur) What’s your name? You sound like Willie.
(Man) What’s your name?
(Arthur) Mine’s Arthur Schaffner. Period.
(Man) Well Mr. Period…
(Arthur) Maybe you got the wrong telephone number. What number have you got? Because I’m a news reporter, and it’s coming in on my police line that’s your number, but I couldn’t call it back. 5133591170, and Dapper(?) says there’s no such number. Now who am I talking to? It sounds like my son, Willie.
(Man) No, somebody transferred me over to you, saying that, uh, uh, they’re with this UPS company, and they got some kind of delivery for me.
(Arthur) You know, whoever your talking, I’m not ashamed to give you my name. I’m 86 years old, been in the law 58 years, and uh, I got a son named Willie, the other one is dead. Me and Robbie was just talking about it. So, I once in a while too dial a number, and then, I try to dial your number back, and the operator comes in right away and there is not such a number, ‘cause they know I’m going into the hospital next week. Because I got wounded. And who am I talking to, or are you ashamed to give me your name?
(Alex Trebek) Uh? Hello?
(Man) No, not really, but I just, I just don’t know what kind of scam these guys are running.
(Arthur) No, now you’re still, still blaming me for something, that I don’t even know you. I don’t know your telephone number. What’d you do, chicken shit and hang up?
(Man) That’s fine.
(Arthur) You must have dialed wrong, fella.
(Man) I guess so.
(Arthur) Yeah, because an operator, when I dial that number, she says there is no such number, ‘cause you’re coming in on uh (tone) I am the biggest reporter in the United States for Police Hall of Fame police magazine, and you’re coming in on our hotline here. The one-nine-one-nine is the hotline, and I run like hell to answer it. And then, I’ll hang up, so I push a button here, I push a button right now, trace that number. Okay, they’re tracing that number to 5133591170, is that your telephone number, or did you dial wrong?
(Alex Trebek) Hello?
(Arthur) Yeah.
(Alex) Yes?
(Arthur) Yeah, just give him that number.
(Alex) No, my phone just rang.
(Arthur) What?
(Alex) My phone just rang, and I picked up. So, somebody’s screwing with the telephone lines. They do it every once in awhile.
(Arthur) Oh, is that what it is? Because whoever got me on the phone’s eating my ass. Hey, he’s calling in on a hotline.

Hello?
Hello, this is Gilligan with Waste Management.
Waste Management?
Yes, ma’am. The next time we come out for collection, we need you to have a list of everything that’s in your recycling bin, okay?
We’re not your customer.
We’re an umbrella organization, ma’am. They all report to us.
So, Best, Best, whatever it is, Best, BestWay or whatever it is, they work under you?
Yes ma’am. So the next time we come out to collect, just have an inventory.
No, I’m not gonna answer nothing to you, unless they call me.
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
Yeah, this is Roscoe with Waste Management calling. For our next pick up, we need you to label all the content of your recycling bin.
That just sounds, that just sounds lovely.
Just get some graph paper and mark down your peanut butter, cupcakes, coffee grounds, things of that nature. Okay?
Oh, okay, well would you take some graph paper and measure your penis with it? For me?
Ahh, I’m not sure how to contact you directly, ma’am. The gentleman of the house is who I was supposed to speak to.
Well I thought, Well hell, I’ll answer the phone now, and maybe lay some Southern charm on you, and see if maybe we could take that graph paper you told me to go buy…
Yeah.
…and lay your penis on it and measure it for me. And I’ll measure my coffee grounds.
Yeah. (Echo).
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
This is Gilligan with Waste Management.
We’re not with Waste Management.
We’re the umbrella organization, they all report to us. We need you to have an inventory of all your recyclables, just go ahead and attach it to your bin the next time we come out for collection, okay? It’s a new policy.
What bins? Are you guys gonna supply bins, or what?
No, the existing bins you’ve already got.
Well, I don’t understand what you want, you know. You want us to do work that we’re paying them to do?
You have to make a list of everything that you put in the bin.
Well it sounds like you’re kidding me.
Okay, if you don’t want to participate, you’ll have an interruption of service for four weeks.
Are you guys gonna reimburse me that four weeks of pay, that I pay up front?
No sir.
Well, you should.
No sir. We’re trying to get ready, we’re going through a metamorphosis here. So, I need you to get with the program, a little bit, alright?
No, you need to get with the program, and send everybody a letter, letting them know ahead of time what’s going on.
We sent you a postcard, but you didn’t reply.
I didn’t see no postcard.
Yeah, I hear that all day long. Why don’t you get some graph paper, and make a list of all your…
Why don’t you mail me some graph paper, and I’ll make a list.
Yeah, that’s your responsibility, not ours.
Well, why is it my responsibility, if I’m paying your trash company to pick up my trash, and now you want me to get graph paper, and this and that, doesn’t make any sense to me.
It’s a new policy, sir. Why don’t you just…
Well, I never heard of no new policy.
You’re hearing about it right now, aren’t you? Why don’t you turn up your phone, if you don’t hear me.
I don’t believe a word you’re sayin’. And quit calling this number.
You’re not gonna get any service, for a month.
Don’t be threatening us, that we’re not gonna get any service. What’s your name, and let me have your direct line, and your bosses’ number.
It a promise, not a threat. My name’s Gilligan, sir, with Waste Management.
Yeah, Gilligan what? What’s your last name?
Tootsie. Okay? And I’ve been here for 16 months, on the job.
That’s not a whole lotta time to be on the job.
So, I know exactly what I’m…
Okay, I’m gonna go ahead and look you up on the web, and see what’s going on here.
I’m gonna look you over, and see if we want to even have you as a customer.
Don’t be calling your customers, we’re the ones that keep your business open over here, and now you’re trying to threaten us?
Ah, you’re not gonna have any business with us, if you keep this up.
Keep what up?
Sir, you gotta comply with us, do you understand?
Let me call my trash company and see what’s going on.

(Announcer) The Gabby Gourmet show, on talk radio 630 KHOW. Now, here's Gabby.
(Gabby) And here we are, and let's go quickly to the phones. Bucko, welcome to this show.
(LPC) Hi, I'm Bucko, I just moved up here from Alamogordo. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.
Alright, I love kohlrabi, I was wondering if you've ever tried it?
I have.
Alright, there's a place in Niwot that serves it, and they serve bumblebee pudding. It's fantastic. And they have, ah...
Are you joking?
Huh?
Are you joking?
Gnocchi? I've had gnocchi befo...
No, no. I said 'are you joking?'.
No. No.
What's the name of the restaurant in Niwot?
It's called Hog Hell. And it's in Niwot, it's on Main Street, oh, it's open 'till two AM. Fantastic! Bumblebee soup, that's a little weird, but I tried it at the bar...
(laughs)
...I love it. 'Cause it's different, ya know?
Yeah. It's made out of bumblebees?
Yes, they set it on fire, and uh...
(Laughs)
...They actually have a catapult, when you come in, they shoot it at ya. It's real different, but you should try it, because it's different...
Uh...I (unintelligible) okay.
(Co-host voice) What do they put in the catapult?
(LPC) They put kohlrabi, and they put all kinds of different things, it smells real, real good. Smells real unusual, but I'm from Alamogordo, and I...
(Gabby) Kay, kay Bucko, I'll take your word for it. Okay, give us the question of the day.
(Co-host) Question of the day, uh, we make fresh focaccia in the house, every night, how many focaccia rolls do we make over a months period?
(Gabby) Okay, give us a guess, we've got to be out of here in one minute.
(LPC) I'm gonna say eighteen-hundred.
(Gabby) Okay. That makes him the winner.
(Co-host) Makes him the winner.
(Gabby) Alright, get his address and stuff. You're the winner of a gift certificate.
(LPC) WHAT!?! Whoo-hoo. Heck of a deal.
(Gabby) I hope you're for real. (Laughs) Okay, hang on, hold. (Laughs).
(Co-host) You know...
(Gabby) Okay.
(Co-host) ...we enjoyed that.
(Gabby) It was great fun.
(Co-host) Different is good, and...
(Gabby) Isn't a catapult when they throw something? (Laughs).
(Co-host) It is.
(Gabby) Okay. It is what I think it is.
(Co-host) I wasn't sure...
(Gabby) Unless it's somebody kidding me, I don't know.
(Co-host) Who knows?
(Gabby) I don't know. However, he won, and you will be getting gift certificates, but give us some time to get them mailed. And (laughs) keep it together, we just (laughs) we'll do something with bumblebee and ginger, next week. See you next week here, and keep listening to 630 KHOW.

NOTE: LPC’s voice does not appear on this track, unless specifically noted. This is an “audio juggling” type call where LPC links different stores.
Platypus?
The only thing’s I’ve got close is Tales From The Woeful Platypus.
I do not know what that book is. Okay, can you ask your friend to call me, so I could talk to him in Chinese? Does your friend, uh, speak Chinese?
Uh, sorry, we don’t have any Chinese speaker here.
I’m sorry, I speak Chinese, okay?
We don’t speak Chinese at all.
Wha…I speak Chinese.
We don’t, sorry.
Which book are you talking about? What’s the book in Chinese?
This is Japanese bookstore.
No, this is the Chinese bookstore. I just told you, this is the Chinese bookstore. We don’t sell Japanese books.
Uh, so what…
You, you speak Chinese?
No we don’t.
Well, I speak Chinese. So I don’t know what book you’re talking about. You gave me a translation in English, which I do not know what that is in Chinese, then how could I look it up? Okay?
Uh how does it sound? O-C-T-O-P-U-S?
I don’t know what octopus book you’re talking about. (Speaks in a different language, presumably Chinese).I speak Chinese, so I spoke Chinese to you.
Um, I don’t understand Chinese.
Oh, okay then. I have to have somebody say the book in Chinese, in order for me to look for it. I need to know what Chinese book you’re talking about.
Nobody speaks Chinese here.
Then, then I can’t help you. (Laughs) If, uh (Laughs).

(phone ringing)
Hello?
Hi, may I talk to Scott?
This is.
Hi, this is Haywood with Otis Elevators.
OK.
Got some mail returned that we had sent to you.
OK.
Guess you didn't see it? From Otis Elevators?
No.
We had actually sent you a bill. There's a fee associated with our elevators when anyone presses more than four buttons at once.You were on surveillance. There's an 89 dollar fee associated, with that, so that's what we're trying to collect here today.
When was this?
January.
January?
Yes sir.
I don't remember being in an elevator back in January.
It was on Hobby Avenue or Indiana Avenue. One of our buildings there. If you just wanted to do the credit card by phone or a routing number by phone we could satisfy the debt that way.
An elevator over on Hobby Avenue?
Yes sir.
What's the building?
It was a city building. There's an 89 dollar fee. It's just to prevent people from pushing buttons willy-nilly. And elevators are not to be toyed with was the reasoning behind the fee.
What was the date of this?
January 2 through the 12th we were doing a big sweep. So within that 10 day time frame sir. You pushed too many buttons, is the long and short of it.
Yeah, well I'm trying to tell you I don't remember being in a building during that time frame.
We
do, okay? It's on vidya. We've even got audio of that elevator ride you took. I'm with Otis Elevators, OK? I've been here-
OK, I don't remember being in an elevator on Indiana Avenue.
-Four years I've been here, OK? We've seen lots and lots of elevators go up and down. And people are pushing too many buttons. It's wearing the things out. This is what you did, and this is what we need: 89 dollars.
I checked the mail everyday and I've never received anything from an Otis Elevator.
Uh-Huh.
You can't even give me a building that I was in that had an elevator.
Well, it got returned to sender sir.
How could it be returned to sender if I never received it?
Well that's the problem. Work it out with your sub-station of your post office. Who knows what else you're not receiving, okay? And then you decide to get in the elevator, go up, go down, whatever you were doing and you pressed in excess of four buttons. It's wearing the thing out double, triple time of what it should be. That's-
The only building that I can ever think of...that is on Indiana Avenue which would have a elevator in it would have been the courthouse in Kankakee.
Oh OK, well then that's uh, 89 times 2...that'd be $198 today. I appreciate your being forthright about this. So just read us the credit number, we'll wipe it out. And in the future just press the one button - boom, we're done.
First of all I'm not going to pay for anything because I haven't seen a bill that says I was there.
OK, well that's between you and the post office sir.
Well no, that's between you and me because you're saying you sent it, I've never seen anything from an Otis Elevator. I'm telling you the only building on Indiana Avenue that would have such a thing is the courthouse and if I'm in an elevator, I'm only pressing one button.
...More like five or six, according to our videotape.
Well, why don't you send me a copy of your video so I can either confirm or deny this?
Because that's private property, it's part of the city.
Well then you send me a fuckin' bill or a picture from your video that says I was there so I can either confirm or deny that I was there. And I'm telling you between the 2nd and the 12th, my ass was sitting in my apartment.
Well there's nothing to deny and we've got audio as well.
OK but see, you're saying you have it - I'm disputing your claim that you have it because I've never seen anything from you.
Oh sir, you were hootin' and hollerin' in this elevator.
I'm hootin and hollerin' in the elevator?
Yessir.
Um...
And that's the reason why we instituted this 89 dollar penalty is to dissuade folks from goin buck wild. OK, so that's the-
First of all, I would not hoot and holler in an elevator. I was raised better than that. Now, can you tell me what I was doing? Obviously you've seen the video.
Oh, you were spinnin' around-
OK...
The people were goin' buck wild.
Um, no. That's not me.
I've been here four years. I have! I've seen it all. I really have.
I would never do no such thing in an elevator.
Oh there was saliva on the ground. Trust me, there was a lot going on there.
OK, you're making this shit up cause I would not do anything like that.
Sir, we have video. We have audio. I've seen it.
Then show it to me!
Private property. It's city property.
Well then it's my word against yours. Now you say I've done this, I'm hootin' n hollerin', I'm slobbering on the ground...
Yes sir.
I'm telling you I didn't, because between January 2nd and January 12th I was home. Now you can't give me an exact date, all you're giving me is a ten day window. You're not telling me what type of building I'm even in for this to happen. You're telling me all this outlandish stuff which is not me to begin with. So, until I see some proof from you, you're not getting a fucking dime from me!
This is non-compliance... right here, is what this is. And there's a surcharge for that. To the tune of sixty nine additional dollars. We can keep going. It's your call.
And I'm telling you until I see some type of proof to your claims, you're not getting anything from me!
Just read the credit card number and we'll just put it behind us, sound good?
You're not getting a credit card until I get proof, buddy!
I've got the proof right here in my video-
Then you show me the fuckin' proof because all I have is your word that such a thing has happened!
Oh you're just joy ridin', is what you're doin.
During that timeframe, I really didn't leave my house that much unless it was to go get groceries.
Not true.
I have lived in Kankakee for 44 fuckin' years. There is no grocery store on Indiana Avenue.
Sir, can you just read us the routing number, we'll satisfy the debt-
You're not getting anything until I get fucking proof! So stop trying to get me on money on shit that I didn't do!
-Or cash.
What part of "You're not getting a dime until I get proof" do you even understand?
I can send you an MP3 of the audio of you spinnin' around, whoopin' it up, acting inappropriate. But you're not going to like what you hear any more than I did, to be frank.
Hell, burn it on a DVD because I've never received anything from an Otis Elevator.
Burn a DVD? This whole incident is burned into my memory. It's unpleasant.
(laughs) The only thing that would have been unpleasant for you to see of anything me doing in an elevator, would be fucking a woman...Which I haven't done in years. And I wouldn't have done it in Kankakee County because the elevators don't go that far.
You're out of control. Ya are!
Well apparently I'm out of control on someone who has generated.. probably a pretty good scam to get people to give them their bank account numbers so that they can drain them of their accounts.
A
scam?
You're buck wild. You're buck wild is what you are. And it's far out.
Well like I said, you're making stuff up because that's not anything I would in an elevator. You're not getting shit until you can generate proof, which I doubt you can do.
Oh, I've got the proof right here in my video machine.
So you say. But like I keep telling you, I've never heard of your company.
We've been in business for one hundred and seventeen years, my good man.
And apparently in 117 years, I'm the worst person that has been in your elevator system.
Again, you read us the routing number, we'll let it go and I'm not going to hold anything against you. That's how big of a guy I am, alright?
Like I said, you show me proof that I did what you said I did in your elevator and you might get some money,.
Oh I'm getting the money, period. There's no two ways about that. Just a matter of if I see you in the courtroom or not. Sir, quit dintzing around the subject and just read the credit card number and the expiration date.
You want a credit card number, here you go: Zero zero zero, zero, zero zero zer- it's all zeroes because you're not getting a fuckin' number! You tell me what building I'm in, and you put screenshots of what the fuck I'm doing. And then I'll take it to my lawyer to see if it's real or not.
Oh it's beyond real, what I'm looking at.
I've never heard of your company so you're gonna try to get my banking information so you can go fund Al Qaeda, or ISIS or whoever the fuck you're funding at this particular moment. I don't know, you could be funding your mom's drug habit, I don't fucking know at this moment. But, until I get all of that, you're not getting a fucking dime. (hangs up)
(ring)
Hello?
Uh, yes. This is Ray Ray with Otis Elevators calling sir.
I've never received anything from you and like I said before when you called, you're not going to get anything until I get something. I talked to my lawyer and my lawyer would like to see a copy of this alleged video of me acting like an idiot in an elevator.
It's indecent. For presentation. So just make the check out to Otis Elevator.
No, you're not going to get anything until I get a bill and I get proof.
I'll give you time to get a pen, that's certainly no problem.
No.
No?
Because if you actually were Otis Elevator, you would show up on my caller ID as "Otis Elevator", not "Mummy Napkin".
My notes say: "Buck wild", "Drool" and "Hog wild". What am I supposed to do with that?
Well, [To friend] Hey, have you ever seen me act buck wild, drool and hog wild in an elevator?
[Friend] I don't think we've ever been in an elevator together..
OK, right there your claim is disputed right there. Do you want to try this shit again?
I'm going to put you through to my manager. I can't through to you. You talk to my manager sir.
(phone ringing)
(Dogs goin' wild, assorted ruckus)
[Manager] Hello? Hold on...Go ahead
What office has a dog screeching in the background?
[Manager] Huh?
Yeah, I'm refuting your claims here because I don't believe you're an actual company. I believe you're trying to scam me out of money.
[Manager] Where are you calling?
Uh, actually you called me.
[Manager] I did?
Yes. Whoever you have there working in your quote unquote office has called me twice, saying that they work for an Otis Elevator company.
[Manager] Yeah it's not me man!
OK, well whoever you have there-
[Manager] It's kind of funny. This isn't an office, it's a residence.
Well you have someone there who has called me twice. And it's popped up "Mummy Napkin" on my caller ID.
[Manager] That's kinda weird man. No, that's not me. It's a residence, I'm telling you that.
I kinda figured it was because the guy was trying to get my information so he could drain my account.
[Manager] No, you need to be careful man.
Alright, thank you for your help.
[Manager] Right on, I wouldn't do that. Later!
Alright, alright.

(Radio Announcer) Bird Talk, your weekly fine feathered feature that helps you get more birds, more often, for more fun. Now, here are your avian amigos, David and Scott Menough.
(Host 1) Well Good Afternoon, and welcome to Bird Talk.
(Host 2) Thank you.
(Host 1) You are listening to the backyard bird feeding specialists, Scott and David, with Bird Talk. And, uh, we’re going to go to the phones, and talk with Tucker today. Hello Tucker.
(LPC)
Well, Good Hello. I got these sucklings from Kathmandu, actually.
(Host) Oh boy.
(LPC) So, I put in a salt lick, and some honeysuckle, and I noticed that the quills of the hatchlings changed the sheath of their plumage. Just like grouses and their nestlings.
(Host) Uh-huh.
(LPC) So, can a curved billed fledgling use its dipper to sort of gape its gizzard? Or would a chicklet in fact nourish its breastbone during migration, like scrubfowl or something?
(Host) Are you just messing with us?
(LPC) Excuse me?
(Hosts) (Laughing) Yeah. (Unintelligible)
(LPC) No, because like, since the culver and its eggs are vertebrates, right?
(Host) Yeah.
(LPC) The fluffy shaft expand to form feather pecking, like a turkey follicle, or something.
(Host) Right.
(LPC) Uh, such as a mandible. Or is the elongated membrane of the peafowl, like a crest feather, uh, on a cockatoo, or maybe a rose breasted cockatiel, in the muscular pouch of the gullet there.
(Host) Sure.
(LPC) And so, I noticed the debeaking of a leghorn rousse, was sort of like a flapping mallard hatchling, and the lobular marcipals of a scrubfowl…
(Host) Uh-huh.
(LPC) …on the elongated membrane of the peafowl. Or a curved billed fledgling.
(Host 1) Well, I think that’s fascinating. I have no response to that, though.
(LPC) So, the dorsal ridge of an insectivore, can develop an egg shell, actually, of the incubated chick.
(Host) Uh-huh.
(LPC) And pigeon milk, contains higher levels than mammalian milk, as well.
(Host) (unintelligible) …over my head, but they’re all definitely facts. Not, uh, necessarily related to one another, but interesting.
(LPC) (Bird sounds in background) Oh, absolutely! That lobular marcipal, on the scrubfowl…
(Host) Uh-huh.
(LPC) Is really what got me to put that salt lick out there.
(Host 1) Well, of course.
(Host 2) What’s been the response to it?
(LPC) The response has been mixed. And I’ve attracted, actually, scorpions, and unrelated creatures.
(Host) Hmmm. And where are you located?
(LPC) I’m in Deckers.
(Host) Okay. And scorpions in Deckers.
(LPC) Scorpions in Deckers. And the honeysuckle has attracted all kinds of other mammalian creatures.
(Host interrupts, unintelligible)
(LPC) And I noticed their quills, and their howlicks, also changed the sheath of their plumage.
(Host 1) Umm-hum. Sure it does.
(Host 2) Heck yes, I noticed that personally.
(LPC) So, can the dorsal ridge of an insectivore develop an egg shell, like an incubated chick?
(Host 1) I don’t know. Maybe one of our callers can, uh, can answer that question. One of our listeners.
(Host 2) Yeah. If you have an answer to that, you can give us a call, and, and, we’ll help Tucker out. Uh, so uh, thanks for joining us today Tucker, that was great. You know, I did not know that we had a lot of scorpions, we have eight different species of scorpions in Colorado. There are about a hundred species of scorpions in the world, we have eight of those in Colorado. I’ve never seen a Colorado scorpion.
(Host 1) No, but, I, I, I’m surprised that it would be at this latitude. Not, not the elevation necessarily, but the latitude.
(Host 2) Yeah.
(Host 1) That is, uh, fascinating. The, uh, maybe we’ll have to develop a scorpion feeder.
(Host 2) I think so. It’s a salt lick, apparently, according to Tucker.
(Host 1) yeah. That’s right. Yeah. We learn stuff from our callers, and from our customers.
(Host 2) We’re never too old to learn, so far.
(Host 1) We can stop reading now.
(Host 2) If you’d like to join us today, tell us about your Colorado scorpion.
(Host 1) Yeah.
(Ring)
Hello?
Yes, this is Federico with United Parcel Service. Who am I speaking with?
James Leafy.
Yes, we've been having a difficulty delivering your parcel and (crazy effects), just wanted to make sure someone's gonna be around. They're dipsticks of some kind, General Motors. And, uh, I'm a supervisor here.
Well, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from General Motors.
Uh, it says Dipsticks dot com. You haven't returned any of our voice mails we've left ya, sir.
Okay, I'm not expecting anything from General Motors.
It's Dipsticks dot com, sir. I believe I stated that.
To the best of my knowledge, I'm not waiting for a package from dipstick dot com. What address are they supposedly going to be delivering this to?
Do I need to talk to, uh, somebody else, or are you the man of the house, or who am I speaking to here?
Well, I told you earlier. My name is James Leafy.
And as I said, I'm Federico. United Parcel Service. I've been here for seven months, uh, here at UPS.
That's fine, but what I'm trying to determine is, whether or not I'm supposed to be the recipient of this. Uhhh, the only (LPC sond effects interrupt).
Yeah?
Ummm, I'm not expecting anything, in the automotive line, which I'm presuming Dipstick dot com has something to do with. Either that or it's a pejorative phrase for something else, but I'm not gonna worry about that.
(LPC Sound Effects) Oh, you're the recipient, I can guarantee you that.
Okay.
Worked here for long enough to determine that, for myself, I don't need to check with...
Well, I'm just trying to determine whether this was supposed to be a delivery to my business, or to my home.
Oh, I've made the determination sir.
Well, I haven't. (Laughs).
Dipsticks dot com, sir. If you can get in gear here, and get the payment prepared, we can resolve this this evening. Have it to ya, uhh...
Sir, I honestly think that you should contact my lawyer, because I've got nothing to do with anybody named Dickstick, Dicks, Dipstick dot com.
Ahh, we've left three voice mails, fella.
No, you have not. Not at this number.
And you have not returned any of our messages, and you haven't responded...
Since I have not gotten them, I haven't returned any.
Yeah, I know you haven't returned any. I've left you a voice mail, I've left you a slip on the door.
At this number?
(LPC sound effects) I haven't heard anything from ya, at all. Nothing at all. I don't know what the, uh, obsticle is, but sir, can we resolve this today? Is my question.
Certainly! If you'll tell me where you anticipate it being delivered. What is the delivery address on the parcel?
Well, I don't have it handy sir, it's on the dock right now.
Ah, well!
(LPC sound effects) Okay?
If you don't have it, then perhaps you should try finding that, so I can determine if this is legitimate.
Sir, I've made the determination, as I said.
But I have not, sir.

(NOTE: LPC's voice is seldom heard on this track, only where specifically noted)
Your name's Coyote?
It sounds like you're just gargling. Umm, You're, uh, sounding like you're not speaking English.
Like (Imitates LPC sound effects) arg, garg, arg, a, garg.
Look Coyote, I don't know what we can do to, umm...
You want me to call you Mister Lederhosen?
Alright, well I made that much progress, great. I got your name.
(brief LPC sound effects heard)
There again, it's going back to the garble-ese. Can you speak into anything else besides a fax machine?
Well, I don't give lobotomies, I'm not a doctor.
(brief LPC sound effects heard)
What do you mean by tantric lobotomies?
There again it's all, uh, just jargonese. (Imitating LPC sound effects) Do, doodle, doot, doodle.
Are you gurgling underwater?
Okay, it sounds like you're gurgling underwater. So it must be that you're using a fax machine, I've never had anybody call me on a fax machine.
I can't understand the words. Although, then, we stop, and I say 'I can't understand the words', then I might be able to hear one or two words.
(LPC) One or two words?
Yeah, I just heard one or two words.
Now it goes into this high pitched (imitating LPC sound effects) Noh,noh,noh,noh.
(LPC joins in with gargling sounds).
And, and it's quite frustrating. So maybe you should hang up and call me back.
(End of track)
(Announcer voice) Denver’s Talk Station 630 KHOW. (Music plays)
(Tom) Hi, Tom Martino, your troubleshooter. Ah, we have more employment questions, hang on, we’ll get right to you. Welcome, what’s going on Dan?
(LPC) I was working, and my manager, at the Denver Puppet Theater, was an eighties rock fan, you know, J. Geils, Boston, Einstürzende Neubauten, and such. And recently, I wore a different shirt during the Spirit of ’76 Festival, for the band Hound. And my manager Juanita said ‘no, no Hound, the singer of that band damaged my puppets,’ and this and that and the other thing, and she said, you know, ‘pound rocks’ basically, get outta here. So, my question is…
Dan, let me ask you this, let me ask you this, this is a puppet theater, right?
Yes.
And you’re a puppeteer, or whatever they call you?
Well, I’ve pioneered a new kind of rubber puppet, but basically, yes. I’m a puppeteer.
Okay, and then another question, are you a W-2 employee, or are you a contractor?
Contractor.
Yeah, well, with a contractor in theater, ‘cause most actors are contractors, and that’s why I asked, you don’t have the same rights as an employee. Isn’t that right, sir?
OHHHHHHH!
(Third voice) That’s true, I mean, uh, then again, depending upon what kind of contract you might have with your uhhh…
(Tom) Yeah.
(Third voice) with your employer.
(LPC) Well, have you heard of a precedent for having a particular band objectionable, and being fired on that basis?
(Tom) Let’s just say for arguments sake, they control enough that he could make the argument he’s an employee, and should have rights. Could they creatively tell him they don’t want him to wear the, the shirt promoting a certain band?
(Fourth voice) I want to make a guess this time, I’m guessing wearing a shirt you want is not a protective class, so yes, you could get fired for wearing something.
(Third voice) Yes, you can absolutely get fired for wearing a particular shirt with a particular band on it.
(LPC) Ohhhhhh!
(Tom) So Dan, they could tell you that your puppet is off base.
(Fourth voice) And if it was a Metallica shirt, they probably wouldn’t. But in your case, Hound.
(Tom) They could. They could say ‘Dan, your puppet cannot wear this shirt anymore’. They could.
(LPC Moans).
(Tom) So you know, if you thought you were gonna sue her, there’s really nothing to sue for.
(LPC) Well, I’ve moved on, like I say I’ve got rubber puppets, I’m doing well. I just wanted to ask.
(Tom) When you say Rubber Puppets, what kind are we talking about?
(LPC) Well, I can’t say too much, because I’m a pioneer, and I invented it.
(Tom) You ought to get ‘em protected if they’re unique. I’m serious. You know, we have an intellectual property attorney, I’ll get you his number. I’m serious by the way. If you came up with something that’s unique, Rubber Puppets, he would help you. He would first of all do a search, and then he could help you protect it. Very serious about that. Okay, we got a lot, coming right back.
(Ring)
Hello?
(LPC voice is warbling thruout call) Yeah, this is Harrison, over at Game Stop. What are you doing up 'ere?
Over at Game Stop?
Yeah. I'm here at Game Stop, on Leetsdale, and we're looking for people to take part in a tournament we got, Fourth of July, we pay 250 dollars...
Everyone who enters gets 250 dollars?!
Yes, cash money. Yes indeed, yes sir. July fourth...
Cash money?
Yeah, July fourth from 1PM to 5 PM, here on Leetsdale Road. Was wondering if you knew anybody who we could recruit, get 'em signed up, and get playing.
I do. I do.
You do. Oh okay, are you any good?
Oh yeah. I'm really good. I'm really excited to go.
Alright, let's see. How much you do you weigh?
Probably about 140.
Now, I wanted to make sure you're gonna fit, and make sure where you're gonna sit, and (warbling continues)...
Wha, what's going on with your voice there?
My voice? I can't take part, because I work here. I'm excluded. Is that what you mean?
Ohhh. Okay. So you can't play the games.
I'm not allowed, because I'm an employee, is that what you're asking?
Yeah.
Because if I did, no offense, you wouldn't stand a chance against me...
Oh, I think I'd put ya down, real quick.
No, you ever heard of Counter Strike?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm probably the best in the country, best player.
No, I'm the top player.
On Counter Strike?
I'm the top player in Counter Strike. Yeah.
No. I'm sorry, not compared to me, you're not. So, but you don't have to worry, because I'm...
I'm a Global Elite.
That's fine.
I'm a Global Elite.
That's fine, I got people offering me thousands of dollars for tips and secrets, so well, I don't think you'd really compare, but don't worry because you're not playing me, you're playing other people, you understand? That's why I say you wouldn't last more than a couple minutes, you'd be defeated, you'd be destroyed. If I were playin' ya.
Who, me?
Yes.
Is this a Counter Strike tournament?
Yes.
No, I would be come...I would win, I would come on top.
What makes you say that?
INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPTION - 2:15 - 4:30 - Not Transcribed
...And you're a novice? Well that's okay, we take everybody.
A novice?? I'm telling you I'm a master, I'm a Global Elite! Do you know what a Global Elite is? Have you ever played Counter Strike before? I thought you were good.
I'm beyond Global Elite, sir. I'm in the stratosphere.
You can't...You can't get past Global Elite.
I'm in the stratosphere, here.
You're in the stratosphere?
Oh, big time. (SFX)
What the hell? What does that mean?
I'm the Great Annihilator, so you're fortunate in that way that you don't have to face me as an opponent. It's be total decimation.
I think that you're fortunate that you don't have to face me. 'Cause I would DESTROY you, pal.
In Counter Strike? In Counter Strike?
Oh, yeah.
You would destroy me?
Oh, yeah.
(LPC laughs, SFX on laughter)
Woah. What's going on with your phone there?
I've told you before, I'm not eligible to be in the tournament.
I KNOW! You've said that already!
(LPC SFX)
But you keep asking me 'What's my story?' and 'What's up with me?' and you don't have to worry, because your not gonna face me. I'm trying to explain...
No, your voice is going (Imitating pitch changes) up and down like thiiiissss.
You're just not prepared, for me. You've (SFX) never...
See there, it's doing it again. It's doing it again!
You've never had to confront someone like me.
What??
I wear gloves, I wear pads, I get into it.
I, I have gloves in game, okay?
Uh, not like this. I get into it. I decimate my opponents. I wear gloves. I wear goggles. I wear a visor.
Well guess what? I'm a fucking wrist player, I wear goggles too. I wear the fucking gunners, the MLG gunners, okay? (LPC SFX) They fucking, they make you, so you can, it's all zoomed in. I can, I can see you before you see me, pal And then I'll deck you! Deck you straight in the head. Annihilated! Off my screen. Everytime!
INCOMPLETE TRANSCRIPTION - 06:30 - 10:18 (end of track) is not yet transcribed.
(Music plays) Leo Laporte, The Tech Guy. And Rolo, Clackamas, Oregon. Hello Rolo!
Hello
Rollo or, Rollo probably, right?
Rollo.
Rollo. Nice to meet you Rollo.
You too. I'm setting up a webinar.
Oh, fun!
I'm going to require an iLok drive to access the FTP site, so I head over to Ali Baba, and I'm on Ali Baba to buy the things, and I should mention my main concern would be data miners. I mean they're just like cyber-crackheads, really. So, I would imagine that any latency issues could be compensated through a registrar handshake with the firmware, and I'd love to see a combination of both flash and HTML5, so my question is, would the eCommerce piece embed on the host platform, as well as the dialogue field for user names? Or, would the gateway socket extension be full duplex, as well as the packet switchover?
Yeah, you're making all this stuff up, aren't you? Come on. (Strange music plays, host laughs) I enjoyed it. It was, it was amusing. Actually, it was pretty close to possible, but not quite there.

Hello?
Hello, it's Bernie. I live next door. (SFX) And I left my shovel up 'ere (SFX) on your property.
I don't have anything on my property.
I left my shovel up there. Ohhhhh. And I need to get it back sometime todayyyyy.
Well, I'm not stopping you from picking it up.
What are you doing up there, rubbin' your buttock?
No, that's what you do. Rub your buttocks.
What if I call the police?
YOU KEEP CALLING ME AND I WILL CALL THE COPS...
Heyyyyy.

(Hang up)
(Radio Bumper music plays) I'm Tom Martino. Let me get to the phones here. Ah, we really got to, okay. So what's going on with Buddy? Go ahead Buddy, what's happening?
(Echo on LPC voice) Yeah, I'm an old corn cob pipe smoker. And my neighbor's sayin' you better extinguish that corn cob pipe up 'ere.
You, you're kidding around, Buddy. This is not a real call, is it? You sou...
Hey.
Buddy?
I said 'If you come into my puffin' parlor, I'm gonna come out whoopin'!' (Echo)
Okay, so, so I don't mind, I don't mind the levity today, there Buddy. So what are you calling about?
Ah, I said 'You better get out of my puffin' parlor', he said 'I'm gonna get you a Section 9', now what does he mean by a Section 9? (Echo 'Nineeahhhh').
(Tom Martino laughs) Buddy, I like your delivery. So listen, tell me about yourself. Are you a voiceover artist, or what do you do?
I'm 75 years old.
Buddy, are you for real?
Are you on his side or...
NO, I...Okay. A Section 9?
(Other radio host) That's when you're nuts, right?
(Tom M) I think.
(LPC) Now, what does he mean by a section 9?
(Tom M, impersonating LPC) I think he means that you are craaaazzzy.
(LPC) I got a helicopter. I'm getting out of here if he's coming after me with a Section 9. (Helicopter sounds)
(Tom M, still impersonating LPC) I think, I think he's sayin' you are nutsssss. Hey, I'm a pipe smoker.
(Other Radio Host) There's a lot of different Section nines, but I think he's referring to the one that, basically, you're insane.
(Tom M) Yeah, he, I, I think that's where they institutionalize you, Buddy. (LPC plays helicopter sounds) So Buddy?
(Other host) He might be callin' from there.
(Tom M.) Buddy? How long you been smokin'?
(LPC) For 45 years.
(Tom M) 45 years? Really? And how old are you?
(LPC) I'm 75 years old, buster.
(Tom M) Okay, and, uh, wh, what is your birthday? The year! Give it to me quickly, sir.
(LPC) I was born in 1943.
(TOM M) Let's see, did he do the math right? 1943? He did? You creep. You did it quickly. Okay, listen, Buddy, he's insane in my opinion. I mean, this guy is truly, truly an idiot. I mean don't you think, Joe?
(Joe) Absolutely, Tom, absolutely.

Robert Bert, may I help you?
Hi. I’m Cedric McCluskie, I’m calling here from Masquerade Masks, here in Shreveport, ah, we got a silent auction coming up, and I wanted to touch base with you, see if could get together on this silent auction, here?
I’m not following, now, repeat what you said.
We’ve got Louisville Sluggers, we’ve got decorated pails and buckets from inner-city kids. A lot of really neat stuff happening here. (SFX) Ohhhhh, oh, oh, ohhhh. And I wanted to get with you, on what you can donate. The lady in the Drone Department said that you could get us some items for our silent auction.
But I’m, I’m not, you know, I’m just a administrator here at Louisiana Tech, and I have no items to contribute. You know, I’ve got my personal stuff, but probably there’s been some confusion. I’m, I’m sorry, I can’t help you. Ah, but...
Well, what have you got in the way of some personal goods and items, that you can…
Sorry, I’m not interested, though, but thank you so much for your call.
Well…
Bye.
...How ‘bout on a cash level?
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Ah, hello? Robert.
Hi, Cedric, how you doing, sir?
Oh, yeah, Cedric. I’m sorry, I’m just not interested or I’m not able to donate anything. I appreciate you asking…
We need a cash donation, then from you, ahh, I can pick that up this evening, if that’s be alright with you.
No, thank you, I appreciate it. My…
Well what’s a good time?
My cash donations go to the church, and to the United Way and also to The Isr...fund for Isr...for the State of Israel.
Okay, I’ll be dropping by in about an hour, and I can pick up just a check, or maybe some staplers, anything you have around the office. I’ll take a reel of tape…
(Laughs) And you’ll meet with the police too.
What do you mean there?
I don’t know what you’re talking about. This, this sounds...Wait a minute, let me re...would you hold on for just a minute, and I, would you record, I, I’m recording this. Hold on please.
I’m gonna come up there, and I’m gonna get with ya. I’m gonna sit down in your office.
Who is this?
I’m Cedric McCluskie, there guy. Masquerade Masks. And if I come up ‘ere, I’m gonna demand cash or check, at this point. You know, maybe I’ll bring a police officer myself.
Who is this? Who is, wha, who is this?
I’m Cedric.
You’re joking now. Who is this?
I told you that before. That goes both ways, fella, I can get a sheriff down there in a matter of minutes. Now cut us a darn check, and quit wasting our time.
I don’t have any, I don’t have any, I do not have any desire whatsoever - (LPC “OHHHHH”) - My contributions goes to the church, and my contributions goes to Israel.
Well you better cut it out. ‘Cause we need to you divert those funds.
I’m fixin’ to divert...listen, I, I’m fixin’ to divert some funds, and it’s gonna be on your head. Do not call this number again.

Academy Records and CDs.
Yeah, I was lookin' for that Country and Western single. Big hit right now.
A big hit right now? What's it called? I don't know. (Laughs)
'Where'd Ya Get Yer Donkey' (Echoing continues "Donkey, donkey...)
(Sighs) Donkey?
It's like: Where'd ya get yer donkey.
Are you sure it's country?
(Donkey continues to echo)
Uh, we don't only sel, uh, specialize in Spanish music here.
Well, it's a Spanish guy. He's from Spain, so...
I'm sorry, I don't have anything from Spain. I just carry just like Tex-Mex...
Well you keep changing your story, 'Oh, I have this, I don't have this.'
Well you know what? Who, who's the guy's name, and why, why are you singing this donkey song?
I think Brent Pickle, is his name.
Brad Pickle? Where Did You Get Your Donkey? What?
(Donkey echoing)
And you got that thing going on repeat and I can't do anything with all the noise going on.
(Donkey echoing)
(laughs) Oh my God.
(New voice) Don't sing me a song, and ask me to go out and find it for ya.
(New Voice) I'm hearing like multiple people talking. It's interfering with what you're telling me. So, like, you gotta fix that before you call back here, okay?
You need to turn down your stereo.
Ah, my stereo is turned down, bro.
You, you need to sit tight. And you need to listen to what I have to say, before you go picking up the phone. You got me figured out? Because, ahhhh, I'm ready to make a purchase here.
I understand you want to make a purchase of something that we don't have in stock, or we don't have a listing for.
Well, I think you probably misspelled it, is what happened. (Donkey echos)
How, how do you know I misspelled it, bro? How do you even know I misspelled it?
Based on...This is all over the radio cat, if you look correctly you'll find it
I don't care if it's all over the radio.
(Donkey echos)
(new voice softly in background, presumably to co-worker) It's Longmont Potion Castle.

Hello, Mullen Books.
Yeah, I just, I have one copy new in paperback, it’s a 15 dollar paperback. But that’s all.
Oh, okay. Ummm ‘All About Hedge Funds’, it’s called?
Uhh, excuse me, no. Maybe I’m still misunderstanding. So, the book I have is ‘The Elegance Of The Hedgehog’. Now did you say ‘hedge fund’?
Yeah.
Oh, well then we’re talking about something totally different. It’s not, not a book I have.
Oh (laughs).
I don’t have anything about hedge funds.
Okay.
Okay, we were just speaking a minute ago, I think, and then a woman got on the line, and then I got confused. I thought she was saying she was looking for a book with ‘hedge fund’ in the title. I don’t think there’s a book by that title.
Well, wait a minute. Who are you?
I’m sorry, you called Bird and Beckett Books.
No, I didn’t call.
Well somebody’s on the phone with me, so it was you that’s just called...before.
I, I, you called me sir, I didn’t call you.
Uh, no I just picked up the phone when it rang. So, there’s some confusion.
I’mmm guessing you’re not the person that was looking for the hedgehog books?
Noooo, I’m sorry.
Ummm hmmm.
Alrighty.
Yeah.
Yeah, you want to give me a call when you have more info?
Uhh, I, I who, who is this? I was looking for a book, ‘Elegance Of The Hedgehog’.
Oh, that’s very strange, somebody was just asking me for a book about ‘leapfrog’. That is extremely strange.
(Laughs).
What just happened?
I don’t know what happened.
(talking over each other).
Yeah, well he was like ‘there’s a book, it’s called ‘How To Play Leapfrog’, and it’s big and it’s yellow and it’s in the back of your store.’ I’m like ‘No, it’s not.’ (Laughs).
Yeah, uh this, this guy called me and said he’s looking for some, something ‘hedgehog’...
That’s so weird. Okay, well maybe if that guy gives you a call back, you can sell him that book, ‘cause he was not happy with me. (Laughs).
Oh no, yeah. Yeah. Leapfrog, I don’t know, he was asking for a leapfrog book.
Hedge, hedge, can you tell me what it’s about?
‘The Eggnog Book’?
Hello, eggnog?
Yeah, I just had somebody ask me for an eggnog book.
Ahhh, no, I don’t have an eggnog. I thought he’d asked for hedgehog. (Laughs).
Okay, did you call previously asking about the hedgehog?
No, this, no, this is Faulkner House Books.
(Freight train sound effects begin).
Okay. God, these phones are getting crossed somehow that’s really bizarre.
Okay, yeah. (Laughs).
Um, and so, sounds like a train is coming through my phone.
Hello?
(SFX stop).
There’s another one, ‘How To Hug A Hedgehog’. That is lesbian fiction.
Okay, um, our lines are getting crossed. Uh, is this Garden District Bookshop? Hello?
No. Hello?
Yeah, this is Octavia Books and someone called and then all of a sudden, I started hearing you mentioning ‘the hedgehog’, and, um, this is the second time this has happened with our lines being crossed with somebody. Who, uh, which bookstore am I speaking with right now?
That is so bizarre. Book Woman.
Oh, where are you all located?
Um, we are at North Lamar.
(Freight train SFX start)
Okay, weird. Well I’m gonna have to let our owner know. North Lamar? It sounds like I hear train, the train out there. Okay, I’m gonna have to let our owner know about that, because this is the second time this has happened. And so what’s the name of your store, again?
The name? Book Woman.
Book Woman, okay, on North Lamar. Okay. Hmm, interesting.Okay, no, yeah, this is Octavia Books, uptown. Yeah, I’m gonna have to let our owner know, because this is the second time our lines got crossed, so I’m gonna let him know what’s going on.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, I’m gonna alert him right now. Okay. Okay.
I’m really sorry, I haven’t been able to find ‘Hedgehog Book’.
Who are you talking...Uh, wait...Hello?
Uh, yes. I was looking for your friend…
Hello?
Yes, your friend was looking for other copies we might have of a book that you bought here. Is that right?
Uh, yeah, but it doesn’t sound like a familiar title to me. Is this a different guy?
Uhhh, he was asking me for...He was asking me for ‘The Hedgehog Book’.
Okay, this is a mystery bookstore.
We are not a mystery bookshop. The shop I think you’re looking for is Aunt Agatha's.
This is Aunt Agatha’s.
That’s your mystery...That’s your mystery bookshop.
Yes, we’re the mystery bookstore.
(Wind SFX briefly play)
Right. Great to talk to you about your bookshop, good luck today.
I was just talking to somebody else. A minute ago…
Oh, no, you were talking to me.
Okay, interesting, okay.
Were you looking for the book ‘The Hedgehog’?
I have no idea what you’re talking about.
This is so weird, did you just have a guy ask you...Oh this is bizarre. It was a man who was just really brusque and annoying.
Hello?
Hello.
Hi?
Hello?
(Chuckles) Yeah, Umm, I looked up the title of the eggnog, and I don’t see anything popping up. And I couldn’t find anything.
(Sirens heard in background)
Yeah, I don’t know, we, we don’t have anything called ‘All About Leapfrog’.
Leapfrog?
Yeah. I, I don’t have anything coming up with ‘leapfrog’.
Uh, he said ‘eggnog’.
Egg-nog?
You called about hedge fund?
No, I didn’t call you.
Okay, uh…
I, I, I work at a hardware store, he called me asking for hedge clippings, and then all of a sudden you came on the line, so…
Hedge...guy must be crazy, that’s all I gotta say. He called here asking for a book on hedge funds. (Laughs). I don’t know what to say.
Hello?
I’m sorry, but I don’t have a ‘Warthog Magazine’.
Who are you calling? This is Louie Brothers Bookstore. You guys keep calling here.
Oh my God, I, I don’t know. I just answer the call. I got a phone call, I just pick up the phone…
Yeah, somebody calling, and they keep calling.
Hello??
Sir, I, I don’t have a book called ‘The Eggnog Book’, I’m telling you.
I’ve got a ‘All About The Hedgehog’ title.
That’s the book you’re looking for?
That’s what he’s looking for?
So he is looking for the hedgehog?
I don’t know if he is or not. Are you there?
I’m here. Yeah, he said he was looking for ‘All About Eggnog’, I thought, is what he told me. (Laughs).
Are you kidding?
Ah, that’s beautiful.
(Laughter) Do you have any more clue than I do?
No.
He told me that he was waiting for a bus, he had no more change, and he was phoning from a pay phone.
So…
And, and I can only hope that your bookstore is in the antipodes. Are you in like, New Zealand or something?
No. I’m in Texas.
Okay. Well, so am I, in Houston.
(High pitched laughing/screaming SFX start)
(Laughter) Alright, well…
Someone had called me and asked me if we had the book ‘I Am The Warthog’.
Okay, this person asked for ‘I Am The Leapfrog’.
This is getting weird. (Laughs).
(Laugh SFX continue).
(Laughs).
Um, okay, and you said it was about eggnog? Right?
I’ve been hearing it’s about a yule log?
I’m sorry, what?
Is it about a yule log, or eggnog?
Are you talking to me, or are you talking to your friend?
(Strange SFX begin, continue to end of track).
To you.
And you think it might be a yule log, not an eggnog?
I, I’m not certain. I hear eggnog from you, I’m not certain what it really is. (SFX) This is the strangest interference ever.
It is, isn’t it.
Yeah. (SFX) Oh, goodness me.
Okay, I am back. I’m back in the back. Now where did you think we had ‘em?
In the fantasy? Oh, you’re talking to a different person. I don’t understand what’s going on. Who, who are you? Are you at a payphone? No, this is a different bookstore.
Well, I don’t want the book. You’re confused.
I understand, I understand.
Yeah, he said it was a yellow book, and he thinks it’s called ‘Welcome To The Warthogs’.
(Bird SFX) Are you, are you hearing the chirping in the line, like I am?
Yeah, I am, it’s kind of confusing.
It sounds like we’re in some bird museum. I mean it’s ridiculous.
Yeah.
So, that’s really weird. So, I’m totally perplexed here on this one. We’re gonna have to just let it go.
(End of track)
(Ring)
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Weller?
Yeah.
This is Hucker, with United Parcel Service, sir. How are you doing today?
Good, what’s up man?
We’ve attempted to bring you a parcel three times in the last six days, and no one’s responded.
Where?
Ah, well, I’m with United Parcel Service, sir. I’m just wondering how late someone’s gonna be there for, for you to sign. (cough with echo effects)
Where are you delivering it?
Oh, well we’re in Century City, at the, uh…
But where are you, where, where are you delivering it? To what address?
Well, I’m the account...I’m not a truck driver, sir. I hope to can un, appreciate that. I’m an accountant here. Letting you know you’ve got a back balance.
(Voice mail message interrupts both LPC and Mr. Weller, presumably this is LPC making a three way call) “Hi, you’ve reached Caitlin, if you please leave your name, number, and a brief message…)
(LPC) Hello?
(Peter) Yeah, I don’t know what’s going on.
(Voice mail continues) ...I’ll be sure to return your call as soon as possible...
(LPC) Is that your, on your end?
(Voice mail continues) Thanks so much. (Beep)
(Peter) No.
(LPC) There must be a mistake. This is UPS.
(Peter) Yeah, I don’t know, man. I don’t what you’re trying to deliver, but you know, I have a post office box where I get all mail. I do not get mail at my house. Ever.
Yeah. Well,UP, UPS will not deliver to a post office box. Ahhhhh(SFX).
Well I don’t know what to do, but…
This is from Banana Boat dot com, does that ring a bell? (Slight echo).
Banana? No, no. No, it does not ring a bell.
Uhhh, well how late is somebody gonna be there tonight? We’ll dispatch another driver. (Sigh with SFX).
No one’s gonna there tonight. I get nothing, nothing at my place of address. Nothing.
But sir, we’ve been there three times already, from UPS, and no one answered the bell.
I, I, I, I don’t even...I don’t know what you’re talking about, because there’s nothing that ever even says what my address is. There’s no record of my address anywhere.
Well, we left ya a slip on the door. (Cough with SFX). And no one replied. Ah, for Banana Boat dot com. Mister Weller, correct? Or wheel, Wheeler?
Yeah.
Okay. Well, Mr. Wheeler, ah, if you’re gonna be there in the next 45 minutes…
It’s Well... I, i, it’s Weller, and no one’s there. And no one receives anything there. So it’s gotta go back...
Peter Weller?
...Yes. Uh, if you’re not telling me the address that they’re sending it to, I can’t help ya.
Well, we can’t just simply send it back, sir. It’s from Banana Boat dot com. (SFX) So, like as I say, I’ll make sure to have an express driver out there in the next 45 minutes for ya, it’s not a problem at all.
No.
Not a problem at all.
Listen, you’re not hearing me!
Oh.
I don’t get anything, and if you’re not telling me an address, I don’t want it or care about it.
Well, okay, we’re UPS at Century City Dispatch Office, ahhh….
Yeah, but you’re not hearing me, man. If you’re not giving me an address where you’re delivering it, I cannot be responsible for it.
My name’s Hucker. I’ll have someone out there in the next 30 to 45, not a problem, okay?
We’re not there! Nobody’s home! Nobody’s home!
Well it’s 110 dollars COD parcel. Ahhh, so we need a check.
(hang up sound)
- (ring)
If you keep calling, I’m gonna call the police right now, man. Bye.
Well, what appears to the the trouble up here, sir?
(hang up sound)
- (ring)
(LPC) Heeeeeeyyyyyyyyoooooo. Hello?
(Peter’s security) Who, who’s…
Sir, we need help bringing this item to your door from the truck, okay?
Here’s what, here’s what I need, can I have your full name, please? And the number you’re calling from?
Ahh, I’m at United Parcel Service, sir.
Which, which office?
Century City. I’m a manger up here. What appears to be the trouble tonight sir?
What is the...well here is the trouble, is that we’ve asked you not to call anymore, I’m private security for this client, and I have a big problem in that you keep phoning. We’ve said to return the items, we do not want to hear from you again, and you persist in calling. So I want to know your name, and I want to know the office number, and I want to know the address. And I want it right now.
This is COD from Banana Boat, is what I’m trying to deliver tonight.
I don’t unders...I don’t care. I want to hear your first name, and your address, right now!
Yeah, okay, well I’m a manager here at United Parcel Service.
Okay, what is your name?
Ah, Doniel, is my first name. D-O-N-I-E-L. Okay?
Last Name?
Last name is Oediv. O-E-D-I-V. And I’ve been here on the job about 14 months, manager, here at United Parcel Service. Century City.
And what’s the number.
Ah, 1-800-PICK-UPS.
(Peter) No, it’s not.
(Peter’s Security) That’s not the number you’ve been calling from.
(LPC) You’ve got my direct line. I just need to get a credit card number to get this payment prepared, and get your parcel delivered. Okay?
Mr. Oediv, listen to me carefully. We are not gonna provide a credit card. And we need these calls to stop, or we will contact law enforcement.
Personal check would be alright.
Are you hearing me, sir? We are in contact with law enforcement, we will make that call. We do not want to hear…
We’re just trying to deliver your parcel, that the guy was about to give me a credit card number…
We do not want the parcel. We have already said we do not want the parcel.
You do not want the parcel?
You are bordering on (fuzzy) harassment.
Did you just change your mind on the parcel, on the product, or…
Yes, we changed our mind (Peter speaking in background: “We don’t want the parcel, not our parcel”) Not our parcel, and you are bordering on harassment, and we will go there if you persist with this, this action. (Peter in background “hang up”).
Okay, well I can let you talk to my supervisor, if, if you’d like. I don’t know what else to tell ya.
Talk to your supervisor? Here’s what we need: I want to make sure you do not call my client again. Is that clear?
Mr. Wheeler?
I don’t know how else to say this, sir. I do not want you to call this phone number again...
Okay. (SFX).
...And if you do, we will contact law enforcement.
(SFX persist) Ohhh, I’m sorry to hear that. I’m trying to help you here today. So are you going to be writing a check? (SFX).
Well the way you’ll help is by not using this…
Are you gonna be writing a check to UPS here today, for Banana Boat dot com? I’m trying to do my job. (Echo).
No we are not. Can I just ask you, I’m now, I’m now very concerned, what is it that you’re not understanding? It is an incorrect parcel, it is not going to my client, we are not going to write a check, and we do not want you to phone this number again!
My job, is what I’m trying to do (Echo) and you’re making that difficult. Exceedingly difficult as this call goes on. (beep, beep).
I’m gonna hang up the phone, if you call my client again, we will contact 9-1-1, am I clear?
Ohhhhhh. I don’t understand. (echo). I really don’t.
Okay, sir, we are contacting law enforcement.
(End of track).

Hello?
Hi, my name’s Guy, with United Parcel Service. How’re you doing today?
I’m doing alright.
Alright, we’ve been out there a couple times, our driver’s reporting that you’re not around for a C.O.D. delivery. Ah, just wanted to know a better time to come back, today or tomorrow.
What?
Our driver sir has got a C.O.D. delivery for you. We need to know a better time for you to, uh, be present, sign for your delivery, pay for it.
What kind of parcel is this?
C.O.D. Four-hundred and sixteen dollars seventy-nine cents. It is Canadian, Flea Genie, it’s some sort of animal product. Are you there between one PM and five PM tomorrow?
At my house? Yeah, I’m there...but an animal product, I don’t feel like I ordered an animal product.
Okay, but he’s rang the bell and no one answered the door, and we can’t just leave it there, you understand?
Okay. Well, uh, yeah, I’ll be there tomorrow.
Ah, and if you wanted to, just go ahead and let us take care of the payment now. And then you can leave it in a safe place.
Like WHAT??
Um, a Visa or MasterCharge.
I never, I never bought a parcel.
It’s from The Flea Genie dot com. So you can take care of your pets, or whatever you got, animals of some kind.
Yeah I don’t, I don’t…
(LPC Sound Effects) Pardon?
(Laughs) What the fuck? (Person in background) Hang up on this dude.
So we’re just waiting for a credit card number.
A credit card number for what? (Talking in background, hard to hear, but something like: “no credit card number, hang that shit up”).
Uh, for Flea Genie dot com.
I’ve never been on Flea Genie dot com. (LPC sound effects) How do you spell “Flea Genie”?
Uh, it says here F-L-E-A G-E-N-I-E dot com. And it’s none of my affair, sir, where you shop. Or what you do. I’m just here at United Parcel Service.
Well, I’m not gonna pay for anything that I didn’t purchase. (LPC SFX).
Yeah, well you made the purchase. That’s not even an issue. We just need to receive payment at this time, okay?
But I, But I, But I didn’t make it, though.
Long number that begins with the four, sir. Followed by the expiration date. (LPC SFX)
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Hello?
Yes, sir, (Hello?) this is Peter, I’m a manager up here at UPS. What appears to be the trouble up here today, sir?
Uhh, I don’t have any trouble.
You’ve got a parcel that you’re not paying for? You’re not paying for your item, is what I’ve been told. (SFX) I’m a manager up here, sir.
What? Why are you guys...why do you guys keep calling me?
What is the issue, sir? Pay for your item, and let’s resolve this issue here today. (SFX) Do you understand? Or?...
(Laughter) I don’t understand.
Four-hundred and sixteen dollars and seventy-nine cents. (loop effect) dollars and seventy-nine cents...dollars and seventy-nine cents. Alright? You can pay with credit card or (quick SFX) check routing number.
Ummm. I (Unintelligible)
Flea Genie dot com?
I never heard of Flea Genie dot com in my life.
Flea Genie dot com?
I never heard of that.
Well, I don’t believe ya, number one.
Why are you guys harassing me now? Why are you harassing me?
I don’t believe ya, matter of fact. I show a purchase history from that very same website, to you. I show a purchase history a mile long. To you.
Now, what does that, what, what, what do they say?
So don’t say that you’ve never heard of it and never seen it or never ordered from it. ‘Cause I see a purchase history a miiile long. Miiiiile long.
What did I buy?
Miiiiile long. (Pitch shift SFX) Miiiiile long. Miiiiile long. A mile long. (Laughter in background) so just if you want to read a credit card number or a…(SFX) routing number, we’ll get it taken care of. But I don’t want to hear this ‘Oh, I’ve never heard of it, I’ve never seen that, I don’t know whatcha mean.’ Skip that, alright buddy?
Woah.
Skip it.
I don’t know, you guys might have to call the police, then.
Stop it. Stop it. Skip it. (SFX) Just skip that nonsense son. Just skip that nonsense son. Ya got it? Look, you want to act big time and make online purchases, well step up to the plate and pay for your item.
(Laughter and high pitched voice in background) Who the fuck are you? Yo.
This is UPS, buddy.
Who the fuck are you?
United Parcel Service. Big time. I’ve been here for four months.
UPS doesn’t talk to me when, when I… If I were to call UPS, they wouldn’t talk to me like this, so…
UPS. I’m a manager. Oh, this is the big time.
(Laughter. In background) I’m a manager!
(SFX) UPS. I’m a manager. Oh, this is the big time here guy. UPS. I’m a manager. Oh, this is the big time here guy.
(Hang up sound)
(LPC with SFX) Ohhhhhhh.
(Ring)
Hello?
Hi, yeah. (SFX)
Hello?
Yeah, how ya doin' up 'ere? (small sfx).
Who's this?
My name's Guy, and uh, I'm with UPS up here. The manager.
UPS?
Yes sir.
Yeah, what can I do for you?
Yeah, we got a parcel here, two, three of 'em, matter a fact. And the driver says no one's been there to sign...It's from Sysco Foods, sir.
Sysco? Hold on a sec.
So, we need to get a check, uhhh, or a credit card payment. Some method of payment here.
Who, whose place you looking for? What is, what is, what is my name?
What is YOUR name? I'm Guy here with, uh, United Parcel Service.
Yeah, what can I do for you? What's my name? You know what my address is?
Oh, sure I do. Sure I do. You got a pizza place, or something, or some kind of restaurant or something. Uhhh, this isn't just a bunch of hocus pocus, this is UPS calling. The guy rings the bell, it's best that you open the door. Is that clear (SFX) or?
(New voice, presumably on a different extension of same line. Until end of call their voices are not differentiated in the transcription) I'm sorry who's this?
Uh, United Parcel Service. Right here in Summerville.
Ah, US Postal Service in Summerville?
It's Parcel service, NOT postal service. It's the same problem we had when we sent our driver out there. 'Oh, the owner's not here, you'll have to come back later.' Uh-uh. We've done that three times already, okay?
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Who's been driving and looking for?
We got a parcel here from Sysco Foods. Is that understood?
You, you got a parcel from Sysco?
Uh, yeah, for the fourth time, yes we do.
What's wrong with this guy?!? (wha, wha) SPEAK ENGLISH! Okay, so I'm, I'm, I'm...
(LPC SFX) Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
...I'm there now, so when can you deliver this parcel?
Oh, so now you want it, huh? (Inhale) Yeah, well we could be there in, uh, 90 minutes, after I'm done eating dinner.
I'm sorry?
Well, you should be sorry. We've been out there four times. You ignored the slip, you ignored your employees. It's time to get...
YOU KNOW WHAT?!? I don't understand you, get someone else.
I'm the executive, I'm in the executive tower here, United Parcel Service.
(Ring)
Hello?
Hi, this is Guy Person, with United Parcel Service. Uh, how are we tonight ma'am?
Listen, is this a joke?
A joke? Sincerely not a joke, ma'am. We're trying to get a delivery made, and no one's there...
Well it's not gonna be tonight, sir.
Oh, is that right?
Okay?!? It's gonna be tomorrow. Alright?!?
Uhhh, tonight works better for me, so uh, if you could...
WELL I GOT NEWS FOR YOU! I DON"T KNOW WHO THE FUCK YOU ARE, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING!
Uhhh, United Parcel Service, ma'am. I've worked here for twelve years.

Oh hey, what's up Vinnie?

Alright well. Check it out - I'm just not gonna deal with you then. You better call somebody else
Hey I got a light that's flickering on and off, a switch that doesn't -do- anything at all when ya flick it. And I got a busted toilet here. What do you expect me to do?
i know you're pissed off man. But ya know. You didn't call me. You haven't sent me an address. You're saying this, that and the other. And I have no idea if you're talking to the right guy because...a light flickering on and off? You want me to come 45 minutes north for
that?
You're not gonna have any idea what
day
it is once I'm done smacking ya 'rrround. (echoing fx)
i don't know who's gonna smack me around bro, but you better be prepared to get smacked the fuck-shit back bro. Cause uh, I don't get smacked around bro. That's all there is to it.
I got a frickin' chain I'm gonna swing around.
Alright, good for you. You better hope that shit connects, cause I'm gonna disarm you, bro. You aren't gonna fuckin' like it when I disarm your ass. And then I got some angry customer coming at me with a chain and then all of a sudden he -doesn't- have a chain. I'm gonna end up breaking something and I'll tell you that straight up. I'm not gonna be a fucking.. fucking happy guy, bro.
Get it done right, Charlie. 'sall I gotta say.
Alright, well... Alright I'll leave now, dude, for $200.
Well, hit the road! I mean, What're ya waitin' for?
An address would be nice...
I sent it to you 3 times on yer text reader.
No, you didn't.
I'm on 907 Stewart Court.
Yeah I don't have that. This is the first time I've talked to you.
You're gonna be talkin' to the sidewalk when you're layin' on it.
Really? Yeah when I'm laying on it, beating your face into it,
That ain't gonna happen.
You don't even know me bro. I swear to God dude, I've got a wild side. You aren't gonna like it.
Ah, you're not gonna know which way is up, Charlie.
Alright I'll just have my .38 in the car that'll come up with me. It'll be with me.
Come up here.
You're gonna see a flag of Florida, flying high in the air.
OK, good.
That's how I am.
OK, well..
So you get up here, I don't wanna have to call you back and say "Oh, it's not done right." Alright?
Hey, i get shit done the first time right everywhere I go, dude.
I'm gonna knock ya down. End of story.
OK, alright. Let's do it. Let's meet up somewhere so you can do what you say and knock me down. So let's just meet up, and then - fuck your sidework - I want you to show me, knock me down.
I'll come to
you.
And I'll show ya how it's done right here in Florida. How's that for a good time?
Alright, that fuckin' sounds good. Why don't you just fuckin' come to me then, brother.
I got a flag of Florida. I'm gonna hang it on my car and I'm gonna drive down to
you.
How's that frickin' sound?
OK, [That's what it's about(?)] I'm down. I'm game. Let's make this happen.
I've got a frickin' 4 foot chain I'm gonna take to your chin.
(laughing). Alright, you take that 4 foot chain...and then when you're disarmed and I'm holding the chain, I'm gonna wrap it around your neck and hang you like a fuckin' nigger from the tree.
I'm gonna wrap ya up in my Flag of Florida and throw ya in the river. What'ya think?
(laughing) You crazy ass motherfucker!
I tell a man about a defective light switch, and you're telling me about this stuff - "Oh I never heard from ya," "Oh I don't know what you're talking about." I mean, what're ya doing? You workin' here or not?
Alright well.. I'm gonna be working on your face, duude, if you don't tell me some truths. Check it out, you want me to send you a picture of my text messages? You're not on here dude. Nor do I have your number saved. Nor have I talked to you before.
I'm gonna send ya a picture of my frickin' fist. In front of the Florida Flag. Flyin' real high.
(laughing) You crazy ass mother fucker. Hey check it out, you can find out somebody to work on your switch, or something. You find out somebody that has a cock and ball joint, OK because, that's my suggestion to you. And if you want to arrange on you getting your ass whooped, then that's fine too. We can arrange that. You give me a call.

(Ring) Little Egypt Veterinary Clinic.
(LPC with effects on voice) Hi, yes, I need to extract a lovebird from a snake. Get procedural here.
Okay, we don’t do anything like that here.
Like what?
(Hang up sound)
(Ring)
Little Egypt Veterinary Clinic, this is (unintelligible) speaking.
Hi, can I talk to a manager on duty, please?
Let me ask real quick.
(LPC SFX - vet clinic laughs)
Hi, this is Gary. How can I help you?
(LPC with SFX) Hi, yes, I need to extract a lovebird from a snake. Ah, sort of an emergency. Ahhh, if we could get that procedure going. It’s save me (LPC laughs, Gary laughs). I’m here in Normal.
You’re in Normal, Illinois?
Yes sir. Yes Doctor. Ahhhh, the bird was gulped, it wasn’t really eaten, so he’s flapping around in there. Just sort of gulped up. It’s a big, big Burmese python.
Okay, why are we calling here?
Well, I’m driving nearby, and I, I saw the sign and I was hoping I could bring him in, and it would just help me out tremendously. (LPC SFX).
I see. (Laughs)
So, like I say, the bird’s flapping, it’s still alive.
Ah.
Ohhhhh. I don’t know what to do, can you help me, Doctor?
Oh, why don’t you just pull in?
Okay, um, also can we talk financing at all?
Uh, not really, not without seeing how many feet it is.
The snake is about 18 feet long.
Ah.
Does that have a bearing on my financial terms that I could potentially receive?
Who am I talking to?
Well, uh, I go by Apeman. I’m a professional wrestler.
Ah.
World Wrestling Federation. Uh, so, I bring that up because of the financing, if you need to verify my employment.
I’m glad I do have wireless call back, okay.
So I’m Buck, but Apeman is what I go by. I’m a wrestler. (LPC SFX)
Ah. Alrighty.
So wha, can you uhhh…
Are you coming by? You read the sign, and what did it say?
Uh, it said veterinary center, to the best of my recollection. Look, I’ve got a, I’ve got a bird flapping around here, and I’m trying to save his life. You can appreciate that, can’t you?
N, n, not really. If it’s already swallowed.
It was swallowed whole, sir. It’s flapping around. It’s wings are flapping, I can see it. I think it can be saved. You know, I’m a lay person, but that’s my opinion. What do you think?
Ah, I think you’ve got the wrong number.
Oh, this isn’t a veterinary clinic?
